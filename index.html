<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="color:#142d56">This weekend features a significant and complex storm system sandwiched between high-pressure ridges.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#142d56">The SW-NE-oriented frontal boundary sliding SE from British Columbia has plenty of warm air and moisture to tap into. It generally moves into a very mild air mass, with the exception of low-level cold air trapped east of the Cascade Crest. Rain reaches the Olympics and Mt Baker areas in the late evening hours and spreads across northern Washington overnight. Ridgeline winds in these areas will become moderate to strong as the moisture plume arrives from the SW.</span></p>

<span style="color:#142d56">The front moves through during the morning hours with moderate to heavy precipitation along with widespread moderate ridgeline winds. Snow levels plummet from around 9000 ft in the morning to 4500-6500 ft by the afternoon. Convergence forming in the mountain loop shifts south toward Stevens by the end of the day, then fluctuates between Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes overnight. A secondary frontal boundary leads an upper trough that arrives Saturday evening with a further drop in snow levels to around 3000 ft. We expect most of the mid and low-elevation snowfall to arrive with this second feature which should favor the west slopes of the Cascades. Expect moderate to heavy snow through mid-morning on Sunday before the upper low slides eastward. The west slopes of the Cascades can expect 6-18" of snow before all is said and done.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#142d56">Some low-elevation areas east of the Cascade Crest and even the passes could experience a wintry mix Friday night and Saturday. This is more likely in the northern passes as low-level cold air is predicted to moderate more significantly in areas south of highway 2 as the precipitation arrives.</span><br/>
