<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Overnight, a frontal system delivered heavy precipitation and extreme winds to the Mt Hood area with significant but lighter precipitation further north. This frontal boundary is now slowly slipping south into central Oregon this morning. The Mt Hood area will see a few more hours of moderate precipitation along with a slow cooling trend this morning, and winds will back off as well.  Further north, showers have filled in on radar and we'll see light to moderate showers over the Cascades and Olympics this morning with snow levels around 2000'.  Showers should become more scattered in the afternoon along with skies becoming broken with a few sunbreaks. Sunbreaks should be more plentiful along the east slopes of the Cascades this afternoon, especially north of I-90, and freezing levels will bump up a bit more on the east side vs the west. </p>
<p>A weak Puget Sound convergence should form tonight as westerly winds pick up, with the convergence zone focusing near and north of Highway 2.  This should add a few inches to affected areas but won't be a big snowmaker or long lived event.  We'll cool off tonight and freezing levels will drop to 1500' or lower by Monday morning.  An upper trough will move over the area on Monday, leading to plenty of afternoon cloud cover and convective showers in a marginally unstable air mass.  Showers will likely increase along the west slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood Monday night. </p>
