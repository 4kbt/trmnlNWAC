<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The ridge of high pressure gradually eases its grip on the region Wednesday night as high clouds move into the region ahead of a disturbance lifting northward. High freezing levels remain in place across the region, but an entrenched cold pool maintains cold temperatures in valleys and mountain gaps near and east of the Cascade Crest. Warm air typically resides above 5000 ft, while overnight temperatures are well below freezing at lower elevations. SW winds continue to try to thin and erode the cold pool, but they are not strong enough to mix down and displace this dense air.</p>
<p>That disturbance starts to bring light rain and snow to Mt Hood in the morning, with precipitation moving into the southern Washington Cascades in the afternoon. Warmer southerly winds aloft will override the cold pool, bringing a chance of snow or a wintry mix in the aforementioned cold-air hideaways. </p>
<p>Behind the shortwave, expect moderate WSW winds and more significant precipitation on Thursday night. Precipitation is likely to start as snow at Snoqualmie Pass in the evening, then turn to freezing rain overnight. Moderate precipitation rates continue into Friday morning before weak ridging reduces precipitation in the southern portions of the forecast region by the afternoon.</p>
