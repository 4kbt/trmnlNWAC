<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The remnants of a weak frontal system is lifting from the SE to NW this afternoon, producing localized moderate precipitation over the Olympics and northwest Cascades, and much lighter precipitation elsewhere. Unfortunately, with high freezing levels, where precipitation is occurring, it's in the form of light rain.  </p>
<p>We'll have a short break between weather systems tonight through Saturday morning.  A splitting frontal system will pack a bit more of a punch on Saturday afternoon as it passes through Cascades.  Look for a quick ramp up for strong S-SE winds late Friday night and Saturday morning, followed by a brief but strong post-frontal period of W-SW ridgeline winds Saturday mid-afternoon through early evening. Snow levels will begin quite high on Saturday morning before crashing to around 4000-4500' Saturday afternoon shortly after the onset of precipitation. This system will feature some upslope along the eastern slopes of the Cascades on Saturday before the frontal passage, so just about all areas are looking at 0.25-0.50" of WE with this storm, with slightly less in the Cascade Passes.  </p>
<p>Showers will linger longest in the Mt Baker area Saturday night.  Yet another system arrives on Sunday, this one the strongest over the short term.  Look for winds to increase on Sunday with precipitation beginning in the afternoon.  The Olympics and Mt Hood area will see rain push the mountain, but the Cascades will largely be insulated from a major warmup on Sunday. </p>
