<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weakening trough moves over the region Saturday morning. This will bring some scattered light rain and snow showers. Decreasing mostly light W winds will focus the majority of the shower activity on the west slopes of the Cascades.  However, some moderate ridgeline winds accelerating down the east slopes of Mt Hood will decrease as the day progresses. The atmosphere will become slightly more convective in the afternoon which may help the scattered shower activity reach areas near and slightly east of the Cascade Crest as well.</p>
<p>Expect shower activity to end early across the west slopes of the Cascades as winds become light and then shift ESE overnight. The ESE winds will increase into the moderate range in favored areas near the Cascade Crest and Mt Hood as an offshore low extends a frontal wave northward. This wave will spread increasing high and mid clouds from south to north into the region. However, most precipitation should hold off until Sunday evening.</p>
