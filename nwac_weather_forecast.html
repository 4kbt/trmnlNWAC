<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The very wet and active weather pattern continues, with moisture streaming in over the top of an offshore ridge. Systems continue to arrive daily with only brief relative lulls between pulses.</p>
<p>Sunday will be a stormy, wet day in the mountains. It features a surface feature tracking toward the Olympic Peninsula. Out ahead of it a warm front continues to bring moderate to heavy rain and higher elevation snow throughout the region on SW winds as snow levels rise to 5000-7000 ft. The low tracks over the northern Cascades by late afternoon, bringing a shift to WSW or W winds, decreasing precipitation, and subtle cooling. Rain or snow shower activity becomes light, and snow levels drop 500-1000 ft.</p>
<p>Monday ushers in the bulk of the atmospheric river event. The strongest moisture feed reaches the coast Monday morning and the Cascades by mid-day, spreading increasing heavy to very heavy precipitation across the region. The heaviest precipitation is likely to take aim on the central and southern Cascades, but the northern Cascades will get plenty. Rainfall amounts should be in the 1-3" range for most areas on Monday, with moderate to strong WSW ridgeline winds bringing plenty of moisture (0.75-1.5" of precipitation) over to the east slopes of the ranges. Snow levels peak late in the day in the 5500 to 8500 ft range.</p>
