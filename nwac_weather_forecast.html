<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The cold temperatures will be the biggest impact of a relatively static weather pattern. NNW aloft keeps our region dry and under the influence of an offshore ridge. Meanwhile, modified arctic air continues to spill into the region from the interior of the continent. Low-level E gradients and weak Fraser outflow at times continues to allow some of this cold air to trickle into the Puget Sound lowlands.</p>
<p>Most mountain locales are off to a chilly start with temperatures in the teens and low 20s. Washington Pass takes the "frozen" cake with a temperature of 4F and a low-level inversion. Temperatures should moderate into the mid to upper 20s in most areas by the afternoon. Expect light and variable winds along with mostly sunny skies.</p>
<p>A disturbance moving in on NNW flow will bring some more widespread high clouds and an uptick in NW or W ridgeline winds. Weak E pressure gradients still favor weak E flow at Snoqualmie Pass. Low temperatures should be similar to Saturday morning but could be slightly colder east of the Cascade Crest on Sunday. Temperatures rebound once again Sunday afternoon on the west slopes of the Cascades, but less further east. Easterly gradients begin to increase late in the day.</p>
