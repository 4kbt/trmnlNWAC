<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Cold, clear/sunny weather continues thanks to a blocking high-amplitude ridge offshore. An upper-level disturbance slides down the backside of the ridge into the Pacific Northwest Sunday morning. This disturbance is associated with an uptick in wind speeds mainly above 6500 ft and a shift in direction from NW to NE. Windspeeds in the low 20s and 10s have been recorded from the upper stations at Crystal Mountain and Mt Hood Meadows, respectively. These winds should ease as the day progresses. The added ventilation generally helped decrease the strength of any inversions by mixing the atmosphere, so most locations have temperatures that are slightly warmer than on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Increasing offshore pressure gradients will gradually increase low-level E winds through places like Snoqualmie Pass over the next 24 hours with these light to moderate gap winds likely peaking Sunday mid-day or afternoon. These winds will also focus the coldest air on the E slopes of the Cascades, but areas further west that are influenced by the E flow should also remain far chillier, likely creating stronger inversions and some temperatures dropping into the single digits in deep valley locations. These east winds peak mid-day on Monday. Afternoon freezing levels should be around 2000-3000 ft on Sunday. However, afternoon freezing levels on Monday vary from 1500 ft E of the Cascade Crest to 7500 ft over the Olympics as the offshore ridge gradually moves onshore keeping the sunny, dry pattern going.</p>
