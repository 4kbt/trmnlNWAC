<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The interminable ridge parked just off our coast remains in place, keeping the weather dry and the skies mostly cloud-free. On this start to MLK day, we've likely reached peak inversion conditions. What does that mean? Typically, temperatures in a well-mixed atmosphere decrease with height. In the current highly stratified atmosphere, middle- and upper-elevation temperatures are significantly warmer than those at lower elevations and in deeper valley locations. Washington Pass upper station is around 20F warmer than the base, Alpental upper station is 16F warmer than the base, and Mission Ridge is 10F warmer than the base. </p>
<p>Light to moderate easterly gap winds continue, as low cloud/stratus laps at the eastern slopes of the Cascades below 3500 ft on Monday.</p>
<p>The biggest piece of uncertainty is the impact of a weak disturbance sliding down the east slopes of the Rockies Monday night. While all the moisture remains east of our area, it could bring some high clouds over our area overnight into early Tuesday. It will also bring some increased, but mostly light WNW ridgeline winds to some areas. These winds will oppose the persistent low-level E winds through the gaps. At this time, we think higher ridgelines and areas away from gap winds will switch WNW overnight into Tuesday morning. However, the major mountain gaps are more likely to experience reduced easterly wind speeds before they pick back up on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The disturbance should also bring subtle cooling on Tuesday, but freezing levels remain well above the Cascade Crest.</p>
