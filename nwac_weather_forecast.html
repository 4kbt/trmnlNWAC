<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We'll see a battle of air masses today with milder air to the west of the Cascade crest and some of the coldest temperatures of the winter near and to the east of the Cascade crest. Mild air is trying to nose its way inland this morning and aloft - place like the top of Crystal and even Camp Muir on Mt Rainier are warmer than most other sites across the Cascades. Most NWAC weather stations are in the teens with even a few single digits, with of course the cold temp winner of Washington Pass base where it's below zero F. </p>
<p>We'll likely see freezing levels "pop" this afternoon to free air-freezing levels over the Olympics, the western half of the West South and Mt Hood as an upper level ridge of high pressure noses over the area. That should coincide with easterly flow backing off this afternoon, and areas like Snoqualmie and White Pass experiencing moderate easterly ridgeline winds should winds decrease and become westerly this afternoon.  We'll also see some high clouds sneaking in from the NW today, making for a period of filtered sunshine near the Canadian border Monday afternoon. </p>
<p>A dry shortwave will pass over the area late tonight brining a brief increase in high clouds but skies should clear out once again on Tuesday.  This upper level feature will also kick up NW winds, so expect moderate ridgeline winds in most areas approaching strong in the alpine on Tuesday. </p>
