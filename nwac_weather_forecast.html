<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A strong frontal system crosses the region from NW to SE on Tuesday through the evening hours, bringing significant snow accumulations to the entire region. The moisture is rapidly spreading across the region early Tuesday, arriving on strong W winds aloft, that will translate into moderate to locally strong WSW ridgeline winds ramping up alongside heavy snowfall as the front approaches. Snow levels start around 2000 ft across the region, but will rise to 2500 ft in the northern Cascades, 3000 ft in the central Cascades, and 3500-4000 ft in the southern Cascades as slightly warmer air moves in briefly during the heaviest precipitation.</p>
<p>Post-frontal showers gradually replace the steadier precipitation during the evening hours, but a powerful westerly push behind the front will form strong convergence and heavy snowfall in the mountain loop. This should drop southward overnight, settling over the highway 2 corridor. Some models show 12-18" of snow Tuesday night for Stevens Pass. This convergence is unlikely to reach as far south as Snoqualmie Pass, but expect mountain enhancement to squeeze out plenty of snow.</p>
<p>Snow ratios increase on Wednesday as snow levels drop to 1000-2000 ft. A secondary disturbance should arrive with the upper-level trough in the afternoon, shifting moderate ridgeline winds from WSW to SSW, and bringing in another more organized band of snowfall. Snowfall remains heavy, despite the lower water numbers.</p>
<p>Areas near and west of the Cascade Crest can expect 2-3 ft of snow above 3500 ft, with 1-2 ft amounts likely east of the Cascade Crest over the next 36 hours.</p>
