<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Make sure to grab your warmest jackets and gloves. The Pacific Northwest sits just on the leading edge of a high pressure ridge that stretches well into the Alaskan Arctic. Northerly flow aloft will bring a steady stream of dry frigid are into our area for the next several days. </p>
<p>A few low clouds and flurries will linger into the evening near Mt Rainier, Mt Hood, and sections of the East South zone, but they won't last long. Dry air pushing in from the north will help skies clear. Look for overnight temperatures to dive, with many 5000ft locations bottoming out close to 0F. Yikes, that's cold! Easterly winds will peak this evening as what's left of a dry front passes over the area. While not a significant east wind event, they'll be noticeable along the Cascade Crest and through the Passes. Combine moderate winds and very cold temperatures and you get wind chill values well below zero. </p>
<p>After a very cold start to the day, sunny skies will help temperatures warm slightly. A few mid to high clouds may pass over the northern portion of the region, but shouldn't have much of an impact. It's hard to say exactly how far south they will drift. Overall, it will be a beautiful, sunny, but chilly day. </p>
<p>The pattern generally repeats Tuesday night into Wednesday. Clear skies let temperatures drop overnight and sunshine helps them warm during the day. Easterly winds may increase late Wednesday afternoon as a significant winter storm undercuts the high pressure ridge far out in the Pacific. This storm won't truly impact our region until at least Thursday, but it's the start of a pattern shift. Until then, bundle up and stay warm!</p>
