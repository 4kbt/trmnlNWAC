<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A ridge of high pressure remains centered over the region and will shift only slightly eastward through Wednesday. The result will be a gradual evolution of the weather pattern, thanks to a shift to SW winds aloft, which brings milder air into the region. However, the cold air pool east of the Cascades remains difficult to displace. The resulting battleground between the air mass occurs near the Cascade Crest and the mountain gaps in horizontal space, but also in the vertical dimension. Expect below-freezing temperatures below 5000-6000 ft near and east of the Cascade Crest, with temperatures firmly above freezing up until 11-12,500 ft within the thick tongue of warm air spilling over the top. </p>
<p>Don't expect much change in the pattern Saturday night or Sunday, but the cold pool may thin slightly. The freezing level top might drop around 1,000 ft by Wednesday. Expect periods of high clouds to increase over the northern half of Washington State on Tuesday and linger over similar areas through Wednesday, with mostly sunny skies farther south.</p>
