<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold upper low continues to rotate off the Pacific Northwest coastline, driving mostly light low-level E flow through the mountain gaps. The low continues to usher light to moderate Fraser outflow winds into western Watcom County through the short-term forecast. Generally, light snow shower activity focuses on the Olympics and the northern half of the Washington Cascades early Wednesday. The upper-level steering winds around the low should guide the shower activity northward, decreasing shower activity over the Cascades and increasing the chances of sunshine as the day progresses. Satellite imagery shows additional snow shower activity offshore that will continue to rotate into the Olympics through the afternoon.</p>
<p>The center of cold upper low retrogrades westward Tuesday evening, further decreasing shower activity. A surface feature associated with the upper low likely pivots toward the mouth of the Columbia River overnight, resulting in some increased light snow shower activity for Mt Hood and SW Washington. Expect light to moderate snow showers for the southern half of the Washington Cascades with more isolated snow shower activity further north. Mt Hood can expect 3-6" with this feature, while areas further north can expect 1-4" of snow.</p>
