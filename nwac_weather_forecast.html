<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's hot for mid-January in the mountains, with widespread 40s and 50s across the region under mostly sunny skies. The coolest spots are down below the inversions, either in the Puget Sound lowlands to the west, or deeper valleys along the east slopes where stratus has been locked in. </p>
<p>While we're in for a week of dry weather, there are a few subtle changes day to day.  High clouds are advancing from a weak upper level weather feature along the North Cascades and Olympics this afternoon. This feature won't bring any precipitation, but will temporarily squash upper level ridging over the area, bringing about some clouds, and a short-lived and relative cool down tonight. Winds will also increase this afternoon through early Thursday morning as the upper level shortwave pushes inland. </p>
<p>Upper-level ridging will rebuild offshore on Thursday and freezing levels will soar right back to 11,000-13,000'.  Mid-mountain high temperatures will be a few degrees cooler than on Wednesday, with high temperatures largely peaking in the 40s Thursday afternoon.  Higher surface pressure building inland will start to drive easterly offshore flow Thursday afternoon and increase further into Friday.  </p>
<p>While freezing levels will look fairly uniform over this stretch, on Friday, we'll see warmer mid-mountain temperatures return west of the Cascade crest, while the Passes and the east slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood remain slightly cooler.  Look for breezy east winds at Pass level, as well as very thin low level clouds approaching and possibly be pulled through the Passes on Friday, especially Snoqualmie. </p>
