<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Tuesday was a generally pleasant day in the mountains. Shower activity tapered off, winds backed down, and the sun graced many slopes, if only for a short time. Upper and mid-level clouds are beginning to stream in ahead of the next weather maker. Though impacts from this next frontal system will begin late Wednesday night, there is still lots of uncertainty associated with the track of the storm. This uncertainty is driving a pretty significant difference in total precipitation and local winds between the models, especially for Wednesday night into Thursday morning after the front passes through.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Here's the general trend: Precipitation begins a little before midnight and increases in intensity in the overnight hours. This storm will spread precipitation on both the east and west sides of the range, with some big bullseyes on the volcanoes. Snow levels start around 3000-3500ft on the west side and 2500ft on the east side, and rise a bit during the day on Wednesday. Snoqualmie Pass and other low-elevation trailheads will lsee some rain out of this system, while mid-elevations and above should see snow, if a little wet at times. Easterly flow subsides late in the day Wednesday as the front passes by. This is where things diverge. Post-frontal storm totals Wednesday night into Thursday could be significant for I-90 and points south, but it all depends on the actual storm track. That track could drive a significant wind event at Mount Hood if it takes the southern route.  </p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Though Thursday should be much less stormy, some model solutions keep things wet, especially for the northern portion of the zone, while others show a short-lived ridge building and keeping things calm until the next storm makes landfall over the weekend. </p>
