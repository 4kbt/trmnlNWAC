<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A ridge of high pressure dominates the region, keeping all but very low clouds and very high clouds at bay.</p>
<p>Depending on your trailhead it could be cold and even socked in to start on Thursday. Rest assured, it's much sunnier and warmer above. With easterly flow, the low clouds and fog hold strong in the eastern forecast zones and Stevens/Snoqualmie Pass. West of the crest and near Mt Hood, morning fog remains more limited and should burn off and become patchy. While freezing levels soar as the ridge shifts inland, air temperatures only top out in the upper 30s to low 40s. </p>
<p>Clouds begin to increase, thicken, and lower overnight ahead of a fast-moving storm with precipitation beginning before daybreak in the Olympics. The main frontal band should bring a round of precipitation from 4-10 AM with moderate to strong SW winds. Most locations west of the Cascade Crest start as rain, but E flow is likely to keep the passes "wet" snow before the mid-morning frontal passage. Snow levels could bump up to 3500 ft just behind the front before re-descending to 3000 ft in the central Cascades as a moist NW flow brings moderate snow showers. We'll have to monitor the timing and strength of a Puget sound convergence zone likely to form between Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes later in the day, just as precipitation is starting to slow down.</p>
<p>We're expecting 2-8" of snow by the end of the day Friday for the west slopes and passes with 1-4" for the east slopes.</p>
