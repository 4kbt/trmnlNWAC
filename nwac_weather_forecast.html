<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest has entered a much quieter weather regime as an amplifying offshore ridge builds influence over the Pacific Northwest. The weather pattern brings dry northerly flow aloft with generally NE ridgeline winds and increasing light E low-level winds through the mountain gaps. This low-level flow is partly driven by a cold pool forming E of the Cascades while subsidence brings warming to areas further west and above the inversion top. Freezing levels will rise from 3000-5000 ft in most areas Monday morning to around 6000-8000 ft west of the Cascade Crest in the afternoon. Further east, expect multiple freezing levels to form in some areas by the afternoon and through Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Tuesday will be even warmer with freezing levels 8000-10500 ft in most areas. The low-level inversion should weaken during the morning areas except in colder valleys east of the Cascade Crest. Expect thick low clouds along the E slopes of the Cascades below 3000-4000 ft, capped by the inversion. With increased offshore low-level flow, don't expect as much cloud west of the Cascade Crest.</p>
