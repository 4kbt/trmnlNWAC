<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today, an NWAC forecaster said, "It's crazy how so much more weather can be happening just 10 miles away." This statement pretty much sums up the variable conditions this afternoon. If you're under one of the lingering convective showers or the Puget Sound Convergence Zone, it may feel very stormy and even wintery. If you're not, or you're on the east side of the range, it certainly feels more like a cool spring day. If you don't like the weather, drive a few miles and you're likely to find something different. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge is building over the region this afternoon, turning upper level winds more northwesterly. This will draw leftover showers to a close.  A few last sprinkles may linger along the west slopes of the Cascades from Hwy 2 to Mt Rainier this evening, but they won't amount to much. The overall trend will be for drying and clearing. Overnight, a few areas of low clouds and fog may form in some mountain valleys and passes. With mostly clear skies, expect 5000 ft temperatures to dip into the low 20s. Conversely, warmer air will start to push into the higher elevations of the Mt Hood and West South zones. So, while lower elevations stay cold, weather stations may show warmer temperatures higher on the volcanoes. </p>
<p>After a chilly start, Sunday looks like a beautiful spring day with plenty of sunshine, light winds, and warming temperatures. A system well to our north may drift some high thin clouds over the region primarily in the afternoon. Another clear night will allow surface temperatures to cool, even as the air mass continues to warm. On Monday, we have more sunshine and even warmer temperatures in store as the ridge shifts inland. The major difference will be the potential for moderate easterly winds along the Cascade crest. Get used to this warm sunny day and cool clear night pattern. It should stay with us through most of the week. </p>
