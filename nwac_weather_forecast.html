<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A dynamic and impactful atmospheric river impacts the Pacific Northwest through the weekend. The first wave that moved through Friday into Friday night brought some cooling. Moderate-intensity organized precipitation on the back of this wave should mostly slide east of the region by 10 AM. Overnight snow in some areas has now changed to back to rain except at upper elevations thanks to a brisk, very moist, and very mild SW flow taking aim at our region.</p>
<p>The main event of the atmospheric river reaches NW Washington in the late morning and afternoon hours, associated with a surface low tracking toward Heida Gwaii. Heavy precipitation reaches the Olympics by late morning, Mt Baker area mid-day, and the mountain loop by mid-afternoon. The heaviest precipitation expands throughout the region during the evening hours, continuing overnight with the highest precipitation rates shifting to the southern Cascades. Snow levels rise to 6000 ft in the north and 9000 ft by Mt Hood.</p>
<p>On Sunday, expect very heavy rain and highest-elevation snow for the southern and central Cascades, with some of the heaviest precipitation shifting back into the northern Cascades during the afternoon. Snow levels will lower to 5000-7500 ft, potentially causing significant snow accumulations at Washington Pass.</p>
<p>Mostly moderate SW winds will continue to buffet the region throughout the storm cycle.</p>
