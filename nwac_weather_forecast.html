<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The complex weather system impacting the Pacific Northwest enters the post-frontal phase as a cold front sweeps through late on Saturday. A well-defined convergence band formed over the Skagit and sweeps southward to Stevens Pass during the evening hours. Models indicate it could stall over Stevens Pass bringing up to 0.75-1" of water equivalent (8-12" of snow) over approximately 6 hours. Most other snowfall will be light to moderate during the evening hours as moderate W winds keep mountain-enhanced snowfall going across the west slopes and passes with some spillover.</p>
<p>An upper trough dropping down the Canadian Coastline re-invigorates shower activity overnight through Sunday. Banded convective showers initially target the mountains of Washington State more, but the focus of activity transitions to the central Washington Cascades southward in the afternoon. Hurricane Ridge and Mt Baker could get some sun breaks at this time.</p>
<p>Snow amounts through the remainder of the storm should be in the 18-24" range for Stevens Pass and Paradise and, 10-20" range for Mt Baker, Crystal, and Mt Hood. Some locations favored by convergence spillover will get significant snow totals on the east slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>A ridge of high pressure rebounds Sunday evening, cutting off snow flurries, and then partially clearing skies overnight. Monday should be cool and sunny with light winds as a ridge of high pressure expands in the nearshore waters.</p>
