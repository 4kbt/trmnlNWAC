<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper-level low pressure sliding down the British Columbia coastline brings a productive snow pattern for the west slopes of the Cascades and passes on Sunday.</p>
<p>With cold air aloft, expect vigorous rain and snow shower activity, including locally intense snowfall, isolated thunder snow, and graupel. Convergence continues to enhance snow totals in the southern mountain loop and Stevens Pass areas where another 6-12" of snow is possible in some areas. Snow shower activity tapers by 10 AM for the Mt Baker and Hurricane Ridge areas and then gradually decreases elsewhere from late morning onwards as the trough slides eastward and WNW flow turns more NNWerly. Before the wind shift, expect moderate ridgeline winds for the central and southern Cascades, particularly near and east of the Cascade Crest where strong gusts continue through the morning hours.</p>
<p>Snow showers taper to flurries in the evening hours on Sunday, lingering longest around Mt Hood. Expect partial clearing overnight with light winds and seasonable temperatures.</p>
<p>A ridge amplifies offshore on Monday, bringing our region a mostly sunny day. Freezing levels start below the passes, but bump up to 3500-4500 ft in the afternoon for Washington State and up to 7000 ft for Mt Hood.</p>
