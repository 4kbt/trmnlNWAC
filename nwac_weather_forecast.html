<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Mountain temperatures this morning are generally near or below freezing along the east slopes of the Cascades and Passes and slightly above freezing west of the Cascade crest. Once the sun comes up, we'll be on our way to a mild Spring day with freezing levels peaking near 8000' in the north and 10,000' to the south. 5000' mid-mountain temperatures will top out in the upper 40s to low 50s today. Locally breezy E-SE winds should back off later this morning along the east slopes and Passes.  High clouds will slip under an upper level ridge of high pressure and make for periods of filtered sunshine Saturday mid-day/afternoon. </p>
<p>A weak frontal system will slowly approach the coast today and tonight, likely pushing light rain onto the Olympic Peninsula before sunrise early Sunday. The front's inland progression will largely stall as the upper level ridge amplifies over the intermountain West. Light rain and high elevation snow will likely push into the west slopes of the Cascades in the afternoon, but may hold off east of the crest until Sunday evening.  Southerly ridgeline winds will increase during the day as well. </p>
