<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Partly to mostly cloudy skies with a few isolated showers are hanging around this afternoon thanks to weak upper level ridging over the area.  We'll see warm air start to nose into the area from the west overnight as an upper level ridge builds offshore.  Freezing levels will bump up more aggressviely west of the Cascade crest during the day on Wednesday while freezing levels will remain lower near the Passes and along the eastern slopes of the Cascades.  A Pacific frontal system will slowly near the area during the day on Wednesday, spreading some high clouds inland, thickest near the coast, and will also increase offshore flow.  Look for moderate E-SE winds to develop in the usual places, through the major Cascade gaps to the western Cascade foothills on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The incoming frontal system will split apart Wednesday night and Thursday with only a few spits of moisture in the form of light showers affecting the Olympics and Cascades.  The system will also bring a fair amount of cloud cover, a switch from E to W winds, and freezing levels settling into a uniform 4000-5000' by Thursday afternoon. </p>
