<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Snow continues for areas near Mt Baker and in the Olympics this morning. Most other locations are experiencing a bit of a lull in the action. This won't last too long. The next round of precipitation is already pushing across the Puget Sound. Snow should increase along the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes mid-day. While a few showers will wander farther east, there isn't great spillover to the eastern forecast zones. The other big story today will be the wind. The strongest winds will be near Hurricane Ridge,  Mt Baker, and Mt Hood. However, nearly all areas will see strong and gusty winds. This could make the afternoon feel quite stormy. </p>
<p>Snow levels remain fairly low throughout the storm. However, cool easterly flow through the passes appears to weaken and turn west this afternoon. This will bring a slight rise in temperatures that could result in a brief period of rain at Snoqualmie Pass. Cooling overnight should return snow to most winter trailheads.</p>
<p>Onshore flow (west) and lingering low-level moisture keep showers going overnight and into Sunday morning. This will help add a few more inches to the storm totals for the Olympics, Mt Hood, the Passes, and west-side forecast zones. While showers should continue into Sunday morning, the overall trend will be for drying and some clearing. Expect precipitation to hang on the longest near the Canadian border. Places further south and east could see appreciable sun breaks and even blue sky in the afternoon. </p>
