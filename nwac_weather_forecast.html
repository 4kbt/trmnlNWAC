<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Dribs and drabs of moisture continue for the west slopes of the Cascades on Thursday. Initially the source of the moisture will be lingering post-frontal flow from a departed system, bringing the final stages weakening convergence to the Mt Baker area early in the day. Moderate to locally strong W and NW ridgeline winds will continue to target the southern Cascades and particularly Mt Hood, but should gradually decrease throughout the day. A flattened or "dirty" ridge moves into the area, drying out the southern half of the Cascades, while limited moisture rides over the ridge for areas further north. Snow levels rise as the day progresses from 3000 to 3500 ft. The east slopes of the Cascades should experience better chances of sunshine with partly to mostly cloudy skies.</p>
<p>The ridge expands slightly Thursday night, limiting chances of light precipitation to the northern Olympics and Mt Baker area. With plenty of cloud cover over the area and some warm air advection, 5000 ft temperatures only drop into the upper 20s to low 30s.</p>
<p>A modest frontal system sags SE on Friday. In the morning, expect some light rain and snow for the Olympics and northern half of the Washington Cascades, expanding throughout the region as the day progresses. Snow levels should be in the 4000-5000 ft range, but thanks to increasing light to moderate E flow, they might be slightly lower for the Cascade passes.</p>
