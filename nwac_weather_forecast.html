<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A shortwave disturbance approaches the region on NW flow Monday afternoon. It will bring several hours of moderate rain and snow during the evening hours, before some post-frontal shower activity lingers into Tuesday. The northern half of the Cascades will be favored initially, but the focus shifts towards the central Cascades overnight as convergence banding sets up somewhere between the Mountain Loop and Snoqualmie Pass. This could bring locally more intense snowfall to elevations above 3500-4000 ft. At the same time, WNW winds should increase into the moderate range, peaking with the frontal passage late Monday night. Middle and upper elevations across the west slopes of the Cascades can generally expect 1-5" of new snow by the time flow switches NNW Tuesday afternoon. The system arrives on a subtle cooling trend.</p>
<p>The offshore high pressure maintains dry northerly flow Tuesday night through Wednesday morning. A weak disturbance should brush the northern portions of the forecast region on Wednesday afternoon, bringing some very light snow with snow levels around 3000 ft.</p>
