<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're off to a chilly start to the weekend with mountain temperatures in the teens and even a few single digits this morning.  The Pacific Northwest is sandwiched between two large scale weather features, the first a strong ridge of high pressure offshore and the second, a digging upper level trough which will eventually become a closed low over California.  What we won't see this weekend is precipitation - we'll continue the meteorological version of dry January well into next week. There will be plenty of sunshine in this pattern. </p>
<p>A slow warming trend will begin over the weekend as the upper level ridge edges closer and noses into British Columbia. Temperatures and freezing levels will slowly warm today, but by Sunday, we'll see some strange freezing level forecasts with milder air first showing over the Olympics and north Cascades and cooler freezing levels further south. The Passes and terrain near the Cascade crest will be a battleground, with above freezing temperatures trying to poke in at upper elevations.  </p>
<p>The other main story with be the winds between the two aforementioned weather features.  Periods of moderate E-NE ridgeline winds will continue through Sunday morning before starting to ease. The exception will be the Mt Hood area where E-NE winds will rip. Combine that with cold temperatures and the wind chill will be no joke despite the sunshine, so layer up appropriately.   </p>
