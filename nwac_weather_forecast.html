<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A long-duration storm system continues to impact the region through the Holiday weekend. Although the primary front moved through, brisk WSW winds continue to feed moderate rain and snow showers into the area as an upper low drifts toward the region. Snow levels range from 3500-5000 ft west of the Cascade Crest, while cold air remaining E of the Cascades keeps the east slopes and passes significantly colder. This also allows precipitation to spill over onto the east slopes of the Cascades, but spillover should gradually decrease.</p>
<p>A secondary feature targets the southern Cascades Sunday night with moderate to heavy rain and snow (light to moderate further north). Upper levels cool slightly, but as E flow gradually decreases low levels near the Cascade Crest may continue to moderate.</p>
<p>Low-level E flow gradually shifts W on Monday as the upper low moves onshore and becomes a trough. Light to moderate snow showers decrease and focus on the west slopes of the Cascades. Snow levels rise from 2500-3500 ft for the Cascade passes, likely shifting Snoqualmie Pass proper to rain.</p>
