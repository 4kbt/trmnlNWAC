<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today will be a bit of a transition in the mountains as we slowly shift from a showery broad open trough to a sunnier high pressure ridge. Exactly how fast the change occurs is hard to say, but overall, the trough seems to be hanging on longer than expected. </p>
<p>NW flow and lingering low level moisture will mean most mountain locations start the day cloudy. While flurries will be a common site, they shouldn't amount to much, if any, measurable precipitation. A few stronger showers could bring a healthy dusting of snow to areas from Snoqualmie Pass to Mt Hood. With generally light winds, there's not much to help mix out these pesky low clouds. However, as the high pressure ridge nudges east into the area we should experience some clearing. Determining exactly when and where the clouds will part is the million-dollar question. Your best bet for partly to mostly sunny skies is near Hurricane Ridge, Mt Baker, WA Pass, and Mission Ridge. Other locations could see sun breaks, but don't seem as likely to develop significant sunshine. </p>
<p>Upper air flow turns more northerly overnight helping the region dry out even further. This should put an end to any showers and push moisture into patchy low level clouds and valley fog. On Monday, a dry short-wave disturbance will approach from the north. As it does, any lingering clouds will be forced further and further south. Instead of precipitation, this little system will mainly cause an uptick in winds. Offshore flow will create stronger easterly winds through the Passes and along the Cascade Crest in the afternoon and evening. Situated on the front edge of this ridge, we'll start a few days of dry, cold, and sunny weather.  </p>
