<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#013969">Cool weather returns to the Pacific Northwest in the wake of a sharp cold frontal passage Friday morning. Shallow instability behind the front combines with a cool, brisk flow to keep the mountain-induced precipitation going. Generally decreasing light to moderate showers focus on the west slopes of the Cascades through the weekend. Moderate to strong W or WNW ridgeline winds accelerate through the mountain gaps, southern volcanoes, and down the east slopes of the Cascades. These winds were averaging 40-50 mph at the top of Mt Hood Meadows and will only ease very gradually over the next 24 hours. For the mountains of Washington State, ridgeline winds should descend into the moderate range on Saturday. Snow levels hovering around 3500 ft Friday drop to 3000 ft Friday evening with diurnally influenced 1000-3000 ft snow levels through the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#013969">The Pacific Northwest sits between a broad trough to the east and a ridge offshore. Weak disturbances will likely move over the region Saturday night and Sunday morning on NNW flow aloft. These disturbances may tap into enough Pacific moisture for periods of steadier light snowfall over the west slopes of the Cascades. Once the disturbances pass, expect partly to mostly cloudy skies, cool temperatures, and light winds with a few snow flurries.</span></p>
