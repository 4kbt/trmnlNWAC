<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Active weather continues through the weekend. An upper low sitting over Washington State provides the instability for isolated bands of shower activity with upper-level WSW to SSW winds ahead of the next system guiding these showers. As the day progresses, these showers will be replaced by steadier and increasing light to moderate rain and snow. Snow levels dropped to around 4000 ft at the coast and 2500 ft near and west of the Cascade Crest Friday night, equilibrating temperatures relative to the east slopes of the Cascades. Temperatures should gradually rise as the next system arrives with moderate ridgeline winds peaking ahead of a frontal passage in the 2-5 AM time frame Sunday morning. With marginal temperatures at Snoqualmie Pass, don't expect significant accumulations until you get above 4000 ft. However, E flow could result in fluctuating snow levels and a slight chance of freezing rain at Pass level. Mt Baker has a favorable flow pattern, but some models have backed off on water numbers, so there's some uncertainty in rain/snow intensity.</p>
<p>Mostly light post-frontal rain and snow showers will continue on Sunday, focusing more on the northern and central Washington Cascades and gradually easing during the afternoon. Expect storm total water numbers in the 0.5-1.5" range, with the highest amounts at Paradise. This should translate into 6-15" of snow above 3500-4000 ft.</p>
