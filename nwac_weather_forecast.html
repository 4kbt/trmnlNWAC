<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Mostly light rain and snow showers activity continues behind a frontal passage during the early morning hours on Tuesday. SSW flow turns increasingly W with cooling temperatures for the W slope of the Cascades as the day progresses. The situation is a bit more complex for the E slopes of the Cascades and passes where a switch from low-level E to W flow should raise freezing levels briefly during the morning hours before cooling aloft begins to lower them later in the day.</p>
<p>Very light snow shower activity continues Tuesday night as onshore flow arrives over a weak ridge, adding very light amounts of fresh snow above 3000 ft going into Christmas day.</p>
<p>A very potent system strengthens as it tracks towards southern British Columbia on Wednesday. The associated strong cold front approaches the coast late in the day, spreading increasing light, moderate, and heavy snowfall into the Cascades. Expect the heaviest snow at Mt Baker along with the strongest S winds. Low-level E flow will also increase through the mountain gaps. Most areas will see snow above 2500-3000 ft for a White Christmas!</p>
