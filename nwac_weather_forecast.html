<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold, unstable weather pattern remains across the Pacific Northwest, and snowfall will continue to accumulate. The trough axis will continue to dig southward in our offshore waters through the weekend, spinning weak disturbances and instability showers into our region. Models indicate a subtle warming trend through Saturday evening as WSW winds gradually switch more SWerly, bringing in milder air. This will raise snow levels from 1500-2500 ft on Saturday to 2000-3000 ft on Sunday. However, light pass-level winds should switch easterly Saturday night through Sunday, keeping the passes chilly.</p>
<p>In this pattern, it is difficult to determine precisely where heavier snow showers will focus in time and space. Models indicate a relatively even distribution of shower activity for the west slopes and passes Saturday morning. The focus of the precipitation gradually shifts northward and diminishes in the southern Cascades. By late Saturday night, Mt Hood will be mostly dry. Some heavier shower activity could move into the Olympics and Mt Baker areas Sunday afternoon as a more organized system approaches the region. Snow shower activity should be mostly light in the central and southern Cascades, but will be enhanced for Mt Rainier and Mt St Helens.</p>
