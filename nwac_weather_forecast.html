<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a messy weather pattern over the Thanksgiving holiday as a frontal system impacts the region. Conditions get particularly tricky at the Passes, where cold easterly flow will battle milder air near and west of the Cascades. Overall, this storm is relatively mild, and while it will certainly add snow to the higher elevations, we may see another round of rain at the lower and potentially middle elevation trailheads. </p>
<p>Radar images on Wednesday afternoon already show precipitation associated with a warm front lifting from south to north across the area. These bands of precipitation will slowly move towards the Canadian border, arriving in the early morning hours. Cool easterly flow may keep Snoqualmie and Stevens Pass near or a bit below freezing, maintaining a slight chance of freezing rain near road levels. However, the reservoir of cold air east of the Cascades isn't very deep and isn't overly cold, limiting its impact at the Passes. </p>
<p>A trailing cold front swings through on Thanksgiving Day, spreading heavier rain and snow from SW to NE. Look for moderate but gusty winds to accompany this front, with locations like Mt Baker, Mission Ridge, Crystal, and Mt Hood potentially seeing stronger wind speeds. Overall, the timing of this storm appears a little later than previously forecasted. So, it may linger well into Thursday night. </p>
<p>While the models have good agreement on the initial frontal systems (Wednesday night and Thursday), they start to diverge significantly Thursday night. Post frontal showers will maintain precipitation along the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics. Some models show the surface low pressure tracking across the southern portion of the forecast region, significantly increasing rain and snow from about I90 southward. If this track holds, it could also produce a period of upslope rain and snow in the Wenatchee Mountains. </p>
<p>While a few showers may linger into Friday morning, the overall trend will be for drying and clearing. A high pressure ridge starts to build over the eastern Pacific, ushering in slightly cooler and drier air. </p>
