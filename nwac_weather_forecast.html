<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High clouds are spilling over the area, slipping under a strong ridge of high pressure.  Afternoon high temperatures for mid and upper elevations were well above freezing as freezing levels soared to 9,000-10,000'. A broad swath of low clouds can be found along the eastern slopes of the Cascades and near Snoqualmie Pass. </p>
<p>We have a subtle change in the weather underway.  A weak Pacific frontal system will split and largely fade as it approaches the coast on Wednesday.  The practical effect will be a steady supply of mid and high level clouds and a slight lowering of freezing levels.  Areas that have strong temperature inversions and stratus this afternoon (portions of the east slopes of the Cascades and Snoqualmie Pass) will likely see the same low elevation pattern stick around tonight through Wednesday. </p>
<p>The main frontal energy will shift into Oregon/Northern California Wednesday night, and some light showers may reach Mt Hood overnight.  The longwave upper level trough associated with this future may lead to some light showers on Thursday. Forecast models are unsure if we'll even see an inch of snow from this feature.  However, we'll see snow levels lower again, into the 3000-5000' range by Thursday afternoon. </p>
