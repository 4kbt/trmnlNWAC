<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The western slopes of the Cascades and Olympics saw some occasional snow showers today, while Mount Hood received a bit more moderate precipitation. Showery activity has become more scattered this afternoon and some mountain locations, especially north and east, have seen a bit of filtered sunshine poking through the clouds. As onshore westerly flow increases this afternoon and evening, a weak and short-lived convergence zone may bring a bit more snow near and north of Highway 2, while the system over Mount Hood continues to produce light snow accumulations during the early evening hours.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Though some slopes may start out with a bit of sun on Monday morning, an upper-level trough will bring increasing cloud cover and westerly winds throughout the day, and another round of convective showery activity in the afternoon and evening. A more substantial convergence zone appears to set up near Snoqualmie Pass Monday night into Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Mount Hood area may get clipped by a more significant system to the south overnight. A partial dry-out is in the cards on Tuesday, perhaps excepting Mt Hood, as a dirty ridge tries to build over Washington. The West Slopes may see a stray shower or two, though the sun looks to make an appearance in many zones. WhateverÂ precipitation does fall during the period should be in the form of snow at all trailhead elevations. If and when the sun pops, expect temperatures to rise quickly.</p>
