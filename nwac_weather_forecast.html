<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Cloudy conditions with light scattered showers will pepper the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes today. Low-level clouds and moisture will fail to push east of the Cascade crest, so expect sunnier conditions along the east slopes of the Cascades and even the eastern side of Mt. Hood. Even on the western slopes, we'll see higher peaks poke out above the low-level clouds. We'll also see locally light to moderate WNW ridgeline winds from about Stevens Pass and south to Mt Hood today with lighter winds to the north. </p>
<p>A ridge of high pressure will move over the area tonight, leading to drier conditions. An unimpressive low pressure system offshore will curl north on Tuesday towards Vancouver Island. Light rain and snow will spread over the area from south to north, starting in the late morning and moving northward mid-day. We'll see an uptick in winds on Tuesday with this system.  Snow levels will come down to 3500-4000' when precipitation begins. </p>
