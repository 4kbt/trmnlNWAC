<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak system fizzles along the Canadian border Thursday morning as it rounds the top of a flattening ridge. The remnants of the system will bring some moderate ridgeline winds to the northern portions of the Cascades from Mt Baker, to Washington Pass, and Mission Ridge. These winds should ease as the day progresses. The system will also bring a mid-level cloud deck to the Olympic northern Cascades in the morning hours with a slight chance of showers for the southern Olympics. Clouds dissipating in the afternoon hours. Other areas should experience mostly sunny skies. Freezing levels remain unseasonably high, ranging from 8000-9000 ft in the north to 10500-11500 ft around Mt Hood. Weak low-level E flow should keep the passes slightly cooler, but these winds could temporarily switch W in the mid-day hours.</p>
<p>Thursday night will bring mostly clear skies, light SW winds at the ridgeline, and very light low-level E winds. Inversions around Washington Pass will not be as sharp as Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Friday will bring mostly sunny skies as the ridge rebounds over the intermountain west. Light winds and 8000-10500 ft freezing levels should make for another spring-like day in the mountains.</p>
