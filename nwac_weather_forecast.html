<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Though cloudy skies persisted over the western lowlands and foothills on Sunday, plenty of sunshine graced the mountains, especially at the middle and upper elevations. 5000ft temperatures ranged from the upper 30s West Slopes and mountain passes to the low 50s east of the crest. Quiet weather is in store Sunday night as temperatures remain above freezing for many mountain locations. Moderate westerly winds decrease in speed overnight and veer to the northwest. </p>
<p>Monday will be a transition day as the quick ridge slides east and a weak weathermaker arrives from the northwest. 5000ft temperatures creep back up into the 40s with the warmest conditions once again taking hold east of the crest and in the southern portion of the forecast area, while the west slopes and passes from I-90 north begin to slowly cool. Cloud cover will increase from north to south throughout the day, and should become widespread along both sides of the crest and down at Mount Hood in the afternoon, while westerly winds increase through the afternoon. Expect light precipitation to begin around midday for the Olympics and by the mid-afternoon for the West North. The front isn't in much of a hurry, and won't begin to spread showers the rest of the zone until overnight Monday into Tuesday.</p>
<p>It's a quick hit of a system with snow levels only decreasing into the 5000-7000ft range. Even the highest elevations aren't likely to see more than a few inches of snow out of this one. By Tuesday mid-morning, the front passes through and clearing begins, especially along the east side of the crest. There could be a few stray showers, especially West Central/North and at Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes, but these won't amount to much. Low clouds may hang in through the day on the West Slopes, while mid and upper elevations should start to see some sun in the afternoon. Then the warm and dry weather returns on Wednesday. </p>
