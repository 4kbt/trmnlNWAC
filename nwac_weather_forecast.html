<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A deep low pressure system passing inland this morning will pepper the region with strong to extreme winds and heavy showers today.  The west slopes of the Cascades will end up with an additional 6-18" on top of what fell last night with lower amounts today for Mt Hood and for the far eastern slopes of the Cascades.  Showers will be heaviest this morning and then become more focused on the central WA Cascades with a Puget Sound Convergence zone forming this afternoon and lasting through the evening. Forecast confidence has increased that this band of concentrated heavier showers will likely target the Mt Loop to Hwy 2 corridor. With strong west winds, expect significant spillover for higher snowfall totals for the central east slopes of the Cascades. </p>
<p>Snow levels will hover between 3000-4000'. When and if showers let up, even if it's been snowing to 3000' (or lower) expect those temperatures to bump up between significant precipitation breaks, especially in the afternoon.  </p>
<p>And let's not forget the winds...westerly winds will be extreme near and south of I-90 to Mt Hood and merely strong near and north of Hwy 2 today.  Strong winds will continue into the evening and then taper Tuesday night.  </p>
<p>A ridge of high pressure will build in Tuesday night through Wednesday.  Look for mild sunny conditions with the mildest temperatures along the west slopes of the Cascades, Mt Hood and cooler temperatures with inversions along the east slopes of the Cascades and Stevens Pass. </p>
