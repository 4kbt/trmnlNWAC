<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Yet another beautiful day across the forecast region. Mostly sunny skies and light winds combined with a warming airmass to create conditions more like April than January. Even still, cold temperatures continue to cling to some of the valleys and passes near and east of the Cascade Crest. </p>
<p>Overnight, mostly clear skies will once again allow temperature inversions to establish in low-lying areas. The freezing levels do a poor job of painting this picture. Even as trailheads become frigid, slopes higher up the hillside should continue to warm. As offshore flow weakens in the wee hours of the morning, more of this mid and upper-elevation warm air pushes further east. </p>
<p>An approaching short-wave disturbance will cause the high pressure ridge entrenched in the eastern Pacific to bend but not break on Thursday. Look for generally high and thin clouds in the morning to slowly thicken and lower as the day progresses. W-NW winds should also increase particularly in the afternoon. This should help mix out any chilly temperature inversions left over from the morning. </p>
<p>While you could see a few flurries near Mt Baker right before sunset, most precipitation should hold off until the evening. Unfortunately, there's not much left of this storm by the time it arrives. Temperatures quickly fall, but without much moisture, it only looks like a dusting of snow for most areas. High-end snow totals of an inch or two could occur from the Mt Loop Highway north, but that's about it. </p>
<p>The high pressure ridge quickly rebounds by Friday morning as the system exists to the SE. Our region is left under cold and dry northerly flow. This should once again bring us plenty of sunshine and cool temperatures. </p>
