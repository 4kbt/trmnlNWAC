<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A disturbance moving down from interior BC has brought widespread mid-level cloud cover to the region on Saturday afternoon, with some very light precipitation reaching the ground in a few areas of the Puget Sound. This minimal moisture will touch off some very light rain and snow from Mt Rainier southerward in the evening hours. Mt Hood has the best chance to pick up around 1" of snow. With cool temperatures in place near and east of the Cascades, expect a dusting of new snow above 3,000 ft for the southern Cascade Volcanoes.</p>
<p>Sunday should be mostly sunny with temperatures moderating. Light low-level E flow will maintain cooler temperatures E of the Cascades, but it won't be as chilly as on Saturday.</p>
<p>High clouds increase across the region Saturday night, with very light rain and snow brushing the mountains of northern Washington on Monday, and obscured skies further south. Temperatures will be slightly above seasonal norms, with the warmest temperatures over the Olympics and southern Cascades.</p>
