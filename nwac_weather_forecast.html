<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">The last week of cold, snowy weather quickly as temperatures moderated dramatically over the last 24 hours. Temperatures are rising into the upper 20s and 30s at many NWAC stations, with high clouds moving in ahead of the next warm, wet series of systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">High pressure keeps conditions mostly dry through Friday night, while freezing levels rise to around 3500–4500 ft in the Washington Cascades and into the upper elevations at Mt Hood. SSW winds ramp up late Friday night and continue to increase until precipitation begins over the Olympics and the Mt. Baker area midday Saturday. These winds could be strong at times in areas favored by this wind direction. Although freezing levels will be above 5000 ft in most areas, expect the atmosphere to cool as it saturates and snow levels to start near 3500 ft before rising. Elsewhere, expect thickening clouds and temperatures in the mid-30s to low-40s at 5000 ft.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">Precipitation increases and expands southward Saturday night and Sunday, remaining more focused on northwest Washington as a warm front lifts northward and snow levels climb into the middle elevations. Models indicate a sharp boundary forming between mild and wet conditions to the north and west, and warm, cloudy, and dry conditions to the south and east. This boundary is likely to set up somewhere in the central Washington Cascades to Mt Rainier. </span></p>
