<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>At 7-8 AM this morning a cold front crossing the Cascades puts an end to the Tuesday through Tuesday night atmospheric river event. This heavy rain, high-elevation snow, and freezing rain in cold valleys east of the Cascade Crest should rapidly drop off or end after 8 AM for most areas. It also comes with strong SSW winds shifting W, creating a convergence band dropping south toward Stevens Pass. The remnants of this convergence could keep more sustained light to moderate rain and snow going in the Stevens Pass area and southern Mountain Loop even as mostly light snow showers rapidly decrease elsewhere across the west slopes of the Cascades through the morning hours. Expect Moderate to strong W ridgeline winds to continue mostly near mountain gaps, the Cascade Crest, and east slopes of the Cascades. But these winds should gradually ease as the day progresses.</p>
<p>A broad ridge of high pressure brings rising freezing levels and increased temperatures overnight for Mt Hood and the Olympics.</p>
<p>The ridge amplifies on Thursday, but a stubby warm front should bring some mostly light precipitation along with S winds for the Olympics and Mt Baker areas. Low-level E winds will bring modestly cooler air through the mountain gaps, with temperatures hovering in the low to mid 30s.</p>
