<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We rang in 2025 with a weak frontal system that passed through last night, dropping 3-5" of snow for the southern volcanoes and lighter amounts further north and east. Today, we'll start off the New Year with lingering snow showers this morning, focused mainly along the west slopes of the Cascades, and with more moderate showers between the Mtn Loop and I-90 corridor where another few inches of snow is possible.  The post-frontal westerly winds don't look particularly fierce, except closer down near Mt Hood this morning. The north Cascades and along the east slopes of the Cascades away from low clouds will see a mix of sun and clouds today.  Cloudier conditions will persist along the west central zones were the aforementioned showers linger longest.  Any clearing further south will be short lived as another weak warm frontal feature will lift over Oregon mid-day and into southern WA this afternoon, spreading high clouds over the region. </p>
<p>Light warm frontal precipitation will lift north from the Mt Hood area into the southern WA Cascades overnight, with another round of light snow perhaps as far north as I-90.  In this fast moving pattern, we'll see another weather feature move into the area Thursday for more widespread precipitation.  More moderate precipitation is likely along the southern periphery, namely the Mt Hood area but confidence is still low.  Cool east winds will keep most trailheads as snow on Thursday in the WA Cascades, but we'll start to see snow levels creep up particularly for the Olympics, Mt Hood area, and for portions of the West South zone including Mt St Helens. </p>
<p><strong>Happy New Year from NWAC! </strong></p>
