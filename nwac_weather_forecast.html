<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">A multi-day atmospheric river event arrives Friday through Sunday night. The initial wave moves through Washington State Friday afternoon, peaks during the evening hours, and tapers to post-frontal showers overnight into Saturday morning. The heaviest precipitation will be in the northern Cascades and Olympics, while moderate ridgeline SW winds buffet the entire winds. Snow levels will be around 5000 ft in the north and 6000 ft in the south. Warm air overrunning a shallow low-level cold pool initially creates a wintry mix for areas near and east of the Cascade Crest, while Washington Pass could pick up several inches of higher-density snowfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">The atmospheric river ramps up Saturday afternoon with moderate to strong SW winds and warming. Heavy precipitation initially targets the Olympics and N Cascades as snow levels rise to 5500-7000 ft. The heavy precipitation rapidly spreads throughout the region in the evening as snow levels peak around 6000-9000 ft. Stormy and extremely wet conditions continue through Sunday evening. Snow levels gradually decrease to 5500-8000 ft on Sunday. There might be a brief, relative break in the action for the mountains of Washington State on Sunday morning before heavier precipitation moves back in. Expect water equivalent precipitation totals in the 2-5” range for west slopes of the Cascades and 1-2.5” totals further east through Sunday.</span></p>
