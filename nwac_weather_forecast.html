<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a warm, wet, and windy day across much of the forecast region. A relatively weak atmospheric river takes aim at the Olympics and North/ Central Cascades. Given the narrow nature of this system, small changes in its position could mean the difference between getting soaked and seeing little precipitation. Areas near and north of Hwy 2 should experience steady rain and high elevation snow. Conversely, south of Hwy 12 conditions should stay dry. It's that area in between where the uncertainty really lies. Cooler temperatures this morning are allowing snow to fall at some trailheads, but that doesn't last long. Warmer air causes snow levels to march up the hillsides. By this evening, rain will reach high into the mountains to the tops of all but the tallest peaks. </p>
<p>The wind is the other major player in this storm. Conditions look very gusty. Stronger gusts could mix down to even lower elevations and surprise you. Even if there are a few ebbs and flows, wind speeds generally stay strong for much of the forecast period. Don't expect much change in the rain, warmth, or winds. This pattern sticks with us until late Monday, when a building high pressure ridge will help us dry out from south to north. </p>
