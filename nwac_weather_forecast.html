<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a nice afternoon around most of the forecast region with generally lighter winds, sun breaks, or even large patches of blue sky. Light snow showers continue to linger near Mt Baker, but even these should soon draw to a close. Our next storm system is already knocking at the door with high clouds moving into Oregon and southwestern Washington. </p>
<p>While most locations will see a similar pattern in the weather, timing will be very different from place to place. This storm arrives in the southern Olympics and south Cascade volcanoes this evening, before moving to near I-90 around midnight, and finally making its way to the Canadian border in the early morning hours. With more southerly flow, this storm will do well along both sides of the range, with slightly less accumulation in the passes. Expect clouds to thicken and lower ahead of the precipitation. With cold air in place, this should mainly be a snow event for common winter trailheads. Look for moderate to strong and gusty southerly winds to increase with the arrival of the bulk of the precipitation. This is a pretty compact storm. Once it washes through, winds will turn more westerly and decrease. Areas in the southern half of the region could see clouds start to part as we once again enter a relative calm between storms. </p>
<p>Starting Monday night into Tuesday, things get messy. Heavier precipitation stays focussed from Mt Hood south down into Oregon. Weather models have a wide range of opinions on what happens next. The main flow of moisture should slowly start to drift northward connecting with a low-pressure system well to our north. Exactly when this happens and how far the moisture tap moves will have massive impacts on how much precipitation we receive. Areas further south have the best chance of additional rain and snow, but they could also see slight warmer temperatures. We'll have to keep watching this one. </p>
