<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a quiet afternoon across the NWAC forecast region with a mix of clouds, sunshine, and even a few very isolated showers. A weak trough will push inland across the area overnight, bringing increasing clouds, cooling temperatures, strengthening winds, and light precipitation. Expect clouds to thicken and lower this evening. How quickly these clouds roll in will have a big impact on the overnight low temperatures and freeze of the snow surface. If they are early, it may be a bit warmer than expected.</p>
<p>Generally, light precipitation should spread from north to south after midnight. Overall, snow levels should be below most trailhead elevations. Since the precipitation arrives right over our forecast time splits (night 1 and day 1), it makes the timing piece important. Even if the "storm" is early (or late), the water totals should be fairly steady for the 24 hr period. There's not a lot of moisture with this disturbance, so most of the precipitation should fizzle out near and west of the Crest north of Mt Rainier. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone could bring locally heavier snow to areas from the Mt Loop Hwy to Hwy 2. </p>
<p>By Saturday afternoon, a building high pressure ridge should quickly draw showers to a close. Look for significant sun breaks and even clearing skies by the afternoon. While sunshine will be most common east of the Crest, on Mt Hood, and in the West South zone, don't be surprised if the blue skies push even further north. </p>
<p>The high pressure ridge continues to build Saturday night. Mostly clear skies and some lingering low level moisture could create fog in some of the mountain valleys and passes. It will be quite chilly (and maybe foggy) to start Sunday, but make no mistake, plenty of sunshine and warming temperatures will make for a beautiful Spring day. </p>
