<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Very active weather continues for the next 36 hours. On Thursday, a Post-frontal W flow behind Wednesday night's frontal passage will bring locally intense convective rain and snow showers to areas near and west of the Cascades Crest. With cooler air moving in aloft, expect increased convection, higher snow-to-liquid ratios, and periods of graupel. Moderate WSW winds will continue to buffet the region.</p>
<p>A developing storm system focuses more of the precipitation on the southern Cascades and the Olympics as we head late in the day. That moderate to heavy precipitation will spread northward during the evening hours as a warm and cold frontal package moves onshore with moderate to locally strong WSW winds. Expect a bump in snow levels to 3000-4500 ft. WSW winds continue on Friday with post-frontal vigorous showers. A pulse moving north along a stalled frontal boundary in the southern portion of the forecast region could bring some heavier sustained snowfall to southern portions of the forecast region in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The west slopes of the Cascades can expect 1-2 ft of snow through the end of the work week above the rain-snow line. The east slopes of the Cascades and Hurricane Ridge can expect 6-18".</p>
