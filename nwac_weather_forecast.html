<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today will be marked by weak and ill-defined weather features. A weak warm front will drift north today, bringing some light showers to the south and central WA Cascades. Another upper level feature will bring light showers into the Olympics and northwest Cascades, neither will amount to much in terms of snowfall accumulation.  Things will be more interesting down near the Columbia River Gorge and Mt Hood near the storm track.  After some showers, and/or freezing fog at Mt Hood this morning, light snow will develop as the next warm frontal wave pushes over Oregon this afternoon. Strong ridgeline winds will continue in this area as well. </p>
<p>This warm frontal boundary will stay in place through this evening, until a low pressure system located offshore, begins to lift northward, dragging light to moderate warm frontal precipitation over the area overnight and through Friday.  Offshore flow will crank up, driving strong east winds through the Passes, strong SE ridgeline winds tonight through tomorrow morning, and helping to keep snow levels low.  The caveat will be the Mt Hood area, where freezing rain is possible from late Thursday night through Friday morning.  That freezing rain threat will extend to Snoqualmie and White Passes later Friday, although the chances are lower for these locations.  For areas further west of the Cascade crest, look for a slow warming trend tonight through Friday, with rain starting to push into the 3000-4000' range and even higher over the Olympics. </p>
