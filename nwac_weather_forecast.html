<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Post-frontal showers are peppering the mountains in W-SW flow this afternoon along with blustery ridgeline winds. Many areas are nearing or over a foot of fresh snow from last night through early this afternoon. Showers will continue in earnest for Olympics and Washington Cascades through the evening, adding several more inches to our growing storm totals. </p>
<p>The latest wrinkle in our busy weather pattern is on the way as a frontal wave off the Oregon coast develops into a low pressure system this evening. The low pressure will pass inland through the southern WA Cascades Saturday night.  We'll see steady, heavy precipitation return to the Mt Hood area and the far south Washington Cascades including the Mt St Helens area overnight.  These same areas will see a warming trend along with extreme SW winds. Further north, snow levels will be much cooler, storm amounts will be much lighter, and winds will be much lighter. This juicy quasi-stationary frontal boundary will shift south during the day on Sunday, shoving the heavier precipitation further south into Oregon.  How fast that boundary drifts south is a bit of a question mark, but the heaviest precipitation should wrap up for the Mt Hood area before mid-day Sunday.  An upper level trough will keep showers in the forecast over the WA Cascades and Olymipcs, but showers will be much lighter than they were on Saturday. </p>
<p>After a cold Sunday night with scattered showers, an upper trough over our region will maintain a cool and unstable air mass, leading to an uptick in afternoon and evening showers on Monday.  </p>
