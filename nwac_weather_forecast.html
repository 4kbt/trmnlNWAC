<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a stormy weekend we're in for a quiet spell of weather over the next few days.  A strong upper level ridge of high pressure positioned offshore will slowly drift over our area through midweek.  This will result in a drying and warming trend. We'll see low clouds along the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics clear up for a sunny Monday afternoon. Freezing levels will pop first for the Olympics and Mt Hood area today to near 9000' and methodically work its way east of the Cascades later tonight and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Easterly flow will start back up tonight through the Passes, but low clouds/fog shouldn't be as persistent as it was during our long stretch of dry weather last week The warm air moving in aloft and low level easterly flow will bring about temperature inversions in the Passes and especially along the east slopes of the Cascades below 4500' tonight and Tuesday.  We'll see some high clouds filter over the area on on Tuesday.</p>
