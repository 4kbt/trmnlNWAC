<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for an active weekend of weather, with several rounds of precipitation and winds pulsing over the area in southerly flow aloft.  Snow levels and at times precipitation type will be a moving target, as these systems draw on cooler air along the east slopes of the Cascades and are neither very cold nor abnormally warm.  A warm front lifting north later this afternoon through overnight will bring generally light precipitation to the area.  A more moderate round of precipitation will push over the area Saturday morning, with the heaviest rainfall in the Mt Baker area.  Showers will become light and scattered in the afternoon and we should see sunbreaks, especially for central and southern zones. </p>
<p>Precipitation type-wise, we may see a period of freezing rain after midnight through Saturday morning at Snoqualmie or White Pass, and along the east slopes of the Cascades near and south of I-90.  Along the eastern slopes north of I-90, snowfall is likely, with a few inches accumulating.  Snow levels will be higher along the western slopes of the Cascades, Olympics, and Mt. Hood, with the snowline pushing well into mid-elevations in those zones. </p>
<p>A stronger round of precipitation will bring another round of mid-elevation snow and low elevation rain Saturday night, as S-SE winds ramp up once again, with the strongest winds likely peaking early Sunday morning. Snow levels will slowly fall Saturday night into Sunday, landing in the 3500-4500' range by Sunday afternoon.  The Mt Baker area will likely see the highest precipitation totals over the weekend. </p>
