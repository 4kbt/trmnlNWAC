<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">It was a cool, mostly cloudy day across the zone, with occasional sun breaks. Aside from a stray shower or two early on, the mountains dried out after Sunday night’s system, which dropped the heaviest precipitation around Snoqualmie Pass and lighter amounts along the West Slopes and I-90 north. At 5,000ft, temperatures lingered in the mid-30s and winds eased through the afternoon. A few weak showers are showing up on the radar this afternoon, but they should fizzle by early evening, and aside from a very light shower, most locations should clear further overnight as temperatures fall into the 20s.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">On Tuesday, high pressure offshore builds while dry north–northwest flow aloft sets us up for a classic spring day. Beyond some lingering low clouds early, skies should be partly to mostly sunny, winds very light and variable, and mid-elevation highs in the upper 30s to low 40s. Low and mid-level clouds may build just a bit as the afternoon progresses. The great weather continues Wednesday as the ridge shifts onshore, as each day brings even more sun and further warming.</p>
