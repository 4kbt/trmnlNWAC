<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Dry and mild conditions will be the story over the next week or so as a strong ridge of high pressure takes control along the West Coast.  Some high clouds are riding over the top of the ridge, mainly affecting the northern half of the WA Cascades. As the upper level ridge amplifies, we'll see that cloud cover push north, leading to clear or mostly clear skies across the mountains. Temperature inversions will form Tuesday night, with cooler air and likely some patchy fog/low clouds in valleys and near major Cascade Passes.  Mid and high elevations will stay well above freezing overnight. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, we'll see mid-mountain high temperatures push well into the 50s across the region.  A weak Pacific frontal system will peter out before it reaches the Cascades on Wednesday afternoon.  The main impact of this weather feature will be an uptick in ridgeline and alpine W-NW winds, felt most acutely over the central and northern WA Cascades beginning Wednesday afternoon and peaking late Wednesday evening.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the ridge will rebuild further offshore.  The main impact of this subtle change in positioning will be to encourage deeper cool air inversions along the eastern slopes of the Cascades and the start of offshore easterly flow through the Passes. We may start to see more low level clouds in the Passes or just to the east beginning on Thursday.  Freezing levels will still be absurdly high for mid-January, in the 12,000-14,000' range. </p>
