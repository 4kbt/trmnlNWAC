<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold upper trough off the central British Columbia coast will rotate scattered snow showers over our region for the next 48 hours. Snow showers will be heaviest over the Olympics, the northwest Cascades from Snohomoish County to the Canadian border. Showers will also become more widespread with the potential for a heavier snowfall rates each afternoon and evening. We'll have a cold, unstable air mass overhead and just a little bit of daytime heating will help spark additional shower activity each day.  Even though the precipitation forecast numbers may seem pedestrian by PNW standards, this cold air mass will efficiently squeeze out low-density snow.  Expect a few inches to accumulate each 12 hr period, with the higher totals near and west of the Cascade crest, over the Olympics, and the south/west side of Mt Hood. </p>
<p>Moderate to strong westerly ridgleine winds will slowly ease today through Sunday. This will be some of the coldest weather we've seen this winter.  Mid-mountain temperatures will struggle to reach the low 20s each afternoon and you're likely to encounter lower teens and single digits at higher elevations.  </p>
