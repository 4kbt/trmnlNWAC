<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Other than a stray leftover sprinkle, most mountain locations are dry this morning. An upper-level ridge builds today from south to north, bringing some partial clearing through the first part of the day, mild temperatures, and generally calm winds. It should be a very pleasant day in the hills. Expect a mix of sun and clouds, with increasing mid and upper-level clouds building from south to north throughout the day and afternoon. Freezing levels will be on the rise, cresting Thursday morning around 8000-9000ft.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The upper-level ridge shifts east Wednesday night while cloud cover keeps overnight temperatures warm. The next system arrives on Thursday, with rain spreading inland in the afternoon along with an uptick in wind speed. As of now, most of the precipitation looks to fall between the early afternoon and late evening. Itâ€™s a modest storm at best, and snow levels during much of the precipitation look to be in the 5000-7000ft range, sadly. Temperatures cool rapidly after the front passes through late Thursday night as breezy westerly flow increases, but there may not be much snow left to squeeze out by that point. A post-frontal trough keeps things cool and showery on Friday and Saturday.</p>
