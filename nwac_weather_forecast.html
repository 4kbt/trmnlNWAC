<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A front that passed through the area last night lingers over northern Oregon, bringing decreasing light snowfall along with moderate ridgeline winds to the Mt Hood area. Post-frontal light W flow keeps mostly cloudy over the west slopes of the Cascades. A disorganized band of convergence snowfall may persist over the Mountain Loop area through approximately mid-day. Further east, expect a pleasant day with partly cloudy skies. Temperatures should be near or slightly below seasonal norms.</p>
<p>A weak system approaching from the NW increases the chances for light snowfall overnight. A digging trough offshore on Tuesday will increase cloud cover, spreading light snowfall into areas near and west of the Cascade Crest during the afternoon.</p>
