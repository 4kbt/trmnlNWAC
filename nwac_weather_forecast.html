<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The atmospheric river of moisture is still going strong across Washington State, pumping moisture from the Hawaiian Islands, arcing over an offshore high pressure, and directly into Washington State on strong west winds. All NWAC stations have changed to rain except Camp Muir at 10,000 ft and Washington Pass. We still expect Washington Pass to change to rain during the evening hours as the warm, moist air continues to stream into the region. </p>
<p>Although the heaviest rainfall with this system occurred Tuesday night (insane rainfall rates of 0.4 to 0.67" of water per hour), the precipitation rates have only reduced slightly as the moisture feed aimed from Snoqualmie Pass to the Canadian Border. It should continue to focus most heavily on these areas through the evening hours before drifting southward overnight. A front drifting southward will bring cooler, drier air into northern Washington State and shift the moderate-to-heavy rainfall over the central and southern Cascades. Expect a dusting to an inch of fresh snow for the higher hills above 3500-5500 ft. A warming trend starts as very light precipitation associated with the frontal system lifting northward heads up towards Canada Thursday night and Friday as snow and freezing levels increase yet again.</p>
