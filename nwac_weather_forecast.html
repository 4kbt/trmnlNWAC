<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The weather will deteriorate Friday as a strong winter storm approaches the areas. Expect increasing winds and developing snow showers in the afternoon. </p>
<p>A low-pressure system off the coast is already spinning moisture up from the south into the Olympics and Puget Sound this morning. Showers will continue to work their way further inland throughout the day. Look for winds to turn more southerly and become gusty as the storm draws closer. </p>
<p>The bulk of the precipitation arrives in the evening hours. With southerly flow, this storm will favor areas like Mt Baker, Crystal Mountain, Mt Rainier, and locations along the east side of the range such as Mission Ridge. While not a major storm event, the combination of the gusty winds and periods of moderate precipitation should lead to a stormy night in the mountains. </p>
<p>Most places should see a brief break in the action on Satruday morning before a trailing cold front reinvigorates precipitation in the afternoon. While most trailhead locations should see snow throughout this storm, a shift from east to west flow late Saturday could bring a short period of rain to Snoqualmie Pass. </p>
