<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The high pressure delivers one final day of atypically warm, dry weather as it shifts east over the Intermountain West on Saturday. Expect a sunny and mild start to the day. 5000 ft temperatures vary from the mid-40s to the upper 20s, with the coldest temperatures in deep valley locations east of the Cascades. These low-level inversions and Puget Sound lowland fog should generally mix out by mid-morning as 5000 ft temperatures rise into the 50s in most areas. High and mid-level clouds will increase during the morning hours for the Olympics and the afternoon for the rest of the Cascades ahead of an elongated trough drifting toward the coastline. This feature will keep skies mostly cloudy overnight.</p>
<p>On Sunday, an upper low ejecting from the trough moves southward off the Oregon coastline. It will bring some light rain and snow showers to the Olympics and west slopes of the Cascades as light WNW ridgeline winds develop in the wake of the upper low. Mt Hood has the best chance of picking up 1" of snow with lesser amounts in other areas. Snow levels should be in the 4500-5000 ft range. Expect drier weather east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
