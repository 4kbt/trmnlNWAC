<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We are leaning into April showers...a wet, windy and showery pattern will continue from this afternoon through Tuesday night. An upper level disturbance has spawned an array of showers this afternoon that's traversing across the area from the SW to NE. Moderate to heavy showers will continue through this evening before starting to taper later tonight as snow levels lower to 3500' before daybreak. Moderate to strong SW winds will continue overnight as well. The heaviest snow showers will focus on West North/Central tonight. </p>
<p>We'll get a relative break tomorrow morning, but the same deep NE Pacific trough will send a new frontal system through the area Tuesday afternoon. As the low-pressure center curls over the NW tip of the Olympic Peninsula in the afternoon, the associated cold front will bring renewed, heavier precipitation to the area along with another round of strong SW winds. Snow levels will be slightly lower on Tuesday, hanging in the 4000-5000' during the day. The volcanoes, Mt Baker, Mt Rainier, and St Helens, stand to pick up the most snow tonight through Tuesday afternoon, with storm totals generally 5-10", except 12-20" on the WA volcanoes. </p>
<p>Showers will taper Tuesday evening, but a Puget Sound Convergence Zone will likely deliver some extra accumulations for West Central and West North once again. An upper level ridge will build over the area on Wednesday. Look for more clouds and the odd leftover shower near the Canadian border and west of the crest, with warmer and clearer conditions further east and south. Freezing levels will try to pop up to 7000' near Mt Hood, and 5000' near Mt Baker on Wednesday. </p>
