<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The ridge sitting off the Pacific Northwest coastline on Sunday continues to bring dry, sunny weather to the Pacific Northwest. However, high clouds rounding the backside of the ridge on NNW flow will begin to replace those sunny skies with mostly cloudy conditions by Monday. A poorly defined wave could bring a period of very light precipitation to portions of the region Monday morning. Some models push this precipitation into the northern portions of our region (in our base case scenario), while others push it south and exclude the northern areas. Regardless, the precipitation will be very light and mostly affect visibility. The second wave arrives Monday night into Tuesday morning and should bring a period of accumulating snow (1-3") above 2500-4500 ft to areas near and west of the Cascade Crest. This precipitation arrives on a cooling trend. </p>
<p>WNW and NW winds are likely to focus on higher elevation terrain near and east of the Cascade Crest, peaking in the moderate range early Tuesday morning as the weak frontal system moves through.</p>
