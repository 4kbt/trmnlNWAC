<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A westerly feed of moisture continues to round the top of an offshore ridge, bringing rain and snow showers into the Pacific Northwest. Snow levels have settled around 4000 ft for the northern Cascades and closer to 5000 ft for Mt Hood. We're not expecting much change in snow levels overnight as moderate westerly winds ease and light shower activity generally decreases overnight. </p>
<p>The reprieve will be short-lived as the next pulse of moisture spreads rapidly early Sunday. A closed low should track toward the Olympic Mountains, spreading a warm front from SW to NE across the region Sunday morning. This will bring rising snow levels along with moderate to heavy rain and snow. Easterly low-level flow for most of the day won't hold off the warming much, as increasing moderate SSW winds stream mild air into the region. The low center should cross the Cascades late in the day and will bring 1-2" of water, equivalent to the southern Cascade Volcanoes and 0.25-1" further north.</p>
<p>Another short reprieve arrives Sunday night with only subtle cooling in the northern areas. The main event comes on Monday in the form of a strong atmospheric river. Models have shifted the aim of the firehose slightly south relative to yesterday at this time. Therefore, water amounts will be in the 1-3" range for the southern and central Cascades, with 1-2" amounts further north. Snow levels will rise to 6000-7500 ft during the afternoon and could peak around 7000-8000 ft late in the day.</p>
