<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Scattered showers added some additional cloud cover today, but spring-like temperatures are in full force with afternoon mountain readings in the upper 40s to low 60s. The main shower and thunderstorm focus is still slotted for this evening as a frontal system approaches the coast. The front will take advantage of favorable convective atmospheric conditions, like a relatively humid and unstable air mass, to produce a widespread area of showers and potentially severe thunderstorms late this afternoon through the evening. Once the showers and T-storms get rolling, they should spread from south to north over the area this evening, and then drift further east later tonight. All areas are likely to be impacted, but areas west of the Cascade crest have the best chances for severe thunderstorms, with heavy downpours, large hail, and strong gusty winds. Make sure you're not caught out in these storms later today and tonight. </p>
<p>Showers will become less intense later tonight as the front pushes through and snow levels will finally begin to drop a bit, especially after midnight. A stacked upper low offshore will drift closer on Thursday, keeping showers in the forecast with high uncertainty regarding timing. The Olympics and the Mt Hood area have the best chance of seeing more moderate showers on Thursday. There will be a chance of afternoon thunderstorms on Thursday, but if they do develop, they'll be less intense than the storms we're talking about for Wednesday evening. </p>
<p>Unsettled weather shows no signs of relenting to end the work week. The same low-pressure system will rotate another round of showers Thursday night and again on Friday.  Snow levels will cool to levels not seen since last week, falling to 4000-4500' overnight Thursday and only rising slightly on Friday. </p>
