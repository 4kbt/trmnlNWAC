<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Keep your sunglasses handy with high pressure in control of the weather for the next several days.  Mid-mountain temperatures will be a bit cooler than the last 2 days, with high temperatures "only" in the 40s vs the 50s.  After a weak weather feature moved through last night, drier air is moving in at mid and upper elevations today, keeping low clouds and the temperature inversions shallow and confined to lower slopes/deep valleys.  </p>
<p>As easterly offshore begins to increase today, and ramps up further overnight, we may start to see some low clouds mired along the east slopes of the Cascades get sucked towards the major Cascade Passes.  These low clouds will likely have a harder time making it to the higher Passes; Washington, Stevens and White, but should have an easier time squeezing through Snoqualmie Pass.  Once it sets in, there's not much change in the pressure pattern through Saturday morning.  Easterly Pass level winds will be breezy, and those easterlies may extend up to ridgelines. </p>
<p>Mid-mountain temperatures will start to climb for the Olympics and the west slopes of the Cascades further west of the crest on Friday, and in these areas, we're likely to see mid-mountain temperatures push back near or above 50F.  Freezing levels will remain high, in the 11,000-13,000' range generally, highest down near Mt Hood. </p>
