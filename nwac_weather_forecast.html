<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Midwinter's dry interlude is in its last innings through the middle of the work week. The gradual departure of a closed low closed over southern California and then the Four Corners region brings an end to the blocking pattern. As a result, an offshore high morphs into an offshore ridge on Tuesday and then begins to slide eastward. Any changes to the strength of the ridge over our region will be subtle until late Wednesday as cooler air begins to move in from the north.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest can expect light northerly winds aloft, sunny/clear skies, and 10000-11000 ft freezing levels through Tuesday night. With the high pressure providing subsidence and minimal wind to mix the atmosphere, continue to expect a stratified atmosphere with cold air pooling below 5000 ft east of the Cascade Crest and light to moderate E winds ushering that cold air through the mountain gaps. Cold air pools will be more limited to valley locations east of the Cascade Crest. Expect these inversions to mix out by late morning in most areas Tuesday and Wednesday, but deep valley locations and areas well east of the Cascade Crest may not warm up. Further west, shallower inversions will be more limited to areas influenced by gap winds and proximity to the Cascade Crest, or smaller cold air pools overnight in deep valley locations.</p>
<p>The ridge begins to flatten on Wednesday as the ridge axis approaches the Washington Coast. Clouds and cooling begin to arrive from the north in the afternoon, dropping freezing levels down below the Cascade Crest in these areas.</p>
