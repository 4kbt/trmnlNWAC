<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a generally quiet but breezy Saturday, we're in for a bit of warm, wet, and windy weather. An atmospheric river (AR) is focussed just to our north on Vancouver Island. This narrow band of intense precipitation will slowly drift south this evening, bringing rain and snow to the North Cascades in the evening and then the Central Cascades overnight. The precipitation forecast with this storm is a bit tricky. The band of rain and snow is extremely narrow and has a very sharp edge. That means subtle shifts in its location could have a big impact on how much water you receive. Areas near and north of Hwy 2 have the best chance of significant precipitation. Conversely, areas near and south of Hwy 12 should remain dry. Between the two, there's a lot more uncertainty. Mild temperatures keep snow levels hovering around 4500-5500 feet. Another major factor with this storm is the wind. Look for moderate to strong and gusty winds to continue through the night and into Sunday. There could be some ebbs and flows with speeds, but overall, no major changes. </p>
<p>The pattern doesn't deviate much into Sunday. The narrow band of precipitation stays focused on the Central Cascades and suffers from the same challenge in terms of position and rain totals. A secondary slug of moisture could result in periods of heavy rain and high elevation snow. Temperatures warm steadily throughout the day, causing snow levels to slowly but surely rise. Similar to Saturday night, locations in the East South and Mt Hood zones should stay dry. </p>
<p>If you're looking for a break from the mundane of rain and warmth, you won't find it here. The AR continues its steady soaking of where ever it's firehose happens to land. Near the major axis of precipitation, expect periods of heavy rain and high elevation snow Sunday night into Monday morning. Elsewhere, generally cloudy and windy conditions will prevail. The storm eventually shifts north sometime on Monday. Right now, some weather models wrap up the precipitation during the day, while others keep it going into the evening. But, by this point, snow levels will have crested all but the highest terrain in our region. </p>
