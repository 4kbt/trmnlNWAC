<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The ridge of high pressure dominating our January weather pattern is on its last legs. Wednesday morning has the telltale signs of a strong ridge with strong inversions east of the Cascade Crest and in the mountain gaps. In the 3500-4000 ft range, these inversions are impressive with temperatures rising 20F with a mere 750 ft of elevation gain in places like Snoqualmie Pass. As the offshore ridge gradually flattens, expect light to moderate W and WNW ridgeline winds to impact the Cascades' mountain gaps and E slopes. It will also mix out the low-level inversions in areas south of the Methow.</p>
<p>The first signs of significant change arrive overnight as high clouds spread across the region and freezing levels drop significantly over NW Washington. The flattened ridge reaches the coast on Thursday as WSW and SW ridgeline winds increase. High clouds lower and thicken, with a chance of very light rain or snow for the west slopes of the Olympics late in the day. Freezing levels continue to lower across the mountains of Washington but will be slower to arrive in the southern and eastern Cascades.</p>
