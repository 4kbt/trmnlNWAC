<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After several days of warm, wet, and windy weather, the end is in sight. A high pressure ridge builds into the Pacific Northwest Monday night and kicks what's left of the recent atmospheric river north into Canada. Precipitation will taper from south to north, with just a few drippy showers loitering in the far northern Cascades first thing Tuesday morning. Similar to the precipitation ramping down, the strong and gusty winds that raked the mountains most of the weekend will also finally drop overnight. </p>
<p>If you live by the motto, "if it's not going to snow, it might as well be sunny," then you're in luck. Much of the region could start Tuesday with pesky low clouds in the mountain valleys and passes, but the trend will be for clearing and drying. High, generally thin clouds will probably keep us from going fully 'bluebird' but there should be plenty of filtered sunshine and maybe even some significant sun breaks. Temperatures will also be on the rise. Many sites could see highs peak in the upper 40's or maybe even crest 50 degrees. </p>
<p>With the high pressure ridge taking up residence over the West Coast, we're in for a prolonged period of warm, dry, and sunny weather. Clear skies Tuesday night could result in weak temperature inversions and maybe some patchy fog. These shouldn't last long on Wednesday. Plenty of sunshine should once again help 5000 ft temperatures stay in the 40s and even 50s. Make sure you have the shades and sunscreen handy, the mountains may feel more like spring than mid-January. </p>
