<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The deep, cold low offshore and associated surface comma cloud are spreading bands of precipitation into the Pacific NW on Wednesday, with moderate to heavy snow showers for the southern Cascade Volcanoes. The upper level low becomes an elongated horizontal trough Wednesday night. Meanwhile, the comma moves into the Olympics. As this feature lifts NE, expect the heaviest snow showers to drift from the southern Cascades toward the central and northern Cascades in the overnight hours. Convergence bands likely also form after 10 PM near of just south of Mt Baker, locally enhancing snowfall rates. With cold temperatures at the surface and colder air aloft, expect high snow-to-liquid ratios. Snowfall amounts in 0.1-0.3" range could produce 3-9" of low-density snow. We're expecting the most around Mt St. Helens and Paradise. Continued but waning light E flow should allow shower activity to spill over onto the east slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>The open trough drifts very gradually southward on Thursday, but isolated, very light snow showers or flurries linger over the area. The trough guides a strong, moisture-laden system into California and then toward the Intermountain West. The northern edge of that precipitation shield could reach Mt Hood and Mt Adams during Thursday afternoon through Friday but should be very light. Other areas can expect partial sunshine. The region stays well below seasonal temperature norms, but expect a very subtle moderation trend.<br type="_moz"/>
