<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal system will stall as it pushes into SW Washington and western Oregon today, lifting some light showers into the Mt Hood area and the West South zone.  Areas like Mt St Helens should pick up a few more inches of snow from showers than areas further north and west.  The rest of us will enjoy a short-lived break in what's been an active mid-March weather pattern. Variable cloud cover should allow for some sunny periods and fittered sunshine for the central and northern WA Cascades from midday through the afternoon with more cloud cover further south. </p>
<p>The frontal boundary will get a boost tonight as a longwave upper level trough increases shower activity and pushes the boundary through the Cascades Saturday morning. Look for increasing showers late tonight with heavier showers Saturday morning. Showers will continue through the afternoon but may become scattered in some areas. With the frontal passage, we'll see strong W-SW winds develop over the area starting mid-morning. </p>
