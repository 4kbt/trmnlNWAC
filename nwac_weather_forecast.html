<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A quiet and increasingly warm pattern will extend from the middle of the week into the first half of the weekend. The mountains are basking under sunshine this afternoon with temperatures in the 40s and a few low 50s. There are a few more clouds near the Canadian border east of Washington Pass, but those diurnal clouds will dissipate quickly in the evening. Mid-mountain temperatures will hold near or above freezing tonight as a ridge of high pressure over the West Coast slips inland, with of course the caveat of temperature inversions for low elevations/deep valleys under clear skies and lighter winds.</p>
<p>On Thursday, we'll see even warmer 5000' high temperatures (low to mid 50s) in the afternoon as freezing levels nudge up a bit as well. The flow aloft will back to southerly on Thursday as the surface flow becomes offshore (easterly), a byproduct of the synoptic or big picture pattern and higher surface pressure over the south Canadian Rockies and lower pressure along the PNW coast. These subtle changes will result in a period of light to locally moderate E-SE ridgeline winds starting late tonight and extending through Friday morning. The breeziest conditions will be found near Mt Hood, West South and Snoqualmie Pass.  </p>
<p>Thursday night and Friday will feature continued warmth as the aforementioned upper trough slowly nears the California coast.  We should start to see some high and potentially mid clouds rotate from south to north during the day on Friday.  There's a higher chance for increased cloud cover for Mt Hood and the south WA Cascades during the day with clearer conditions more likely further north. E-SE ridgeline winds will decrease during the day. </p>
