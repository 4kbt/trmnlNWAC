<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The drippy, drizzly, mostly cloudy, and mild weather is expected to continue through Monday, although some areas may experience some improvement at times. The warm, wet weather can be attributed to a moisture feed tied into a cutoff low off the California Coast. As that low shifts away from our region, it should sever the link, resulting in less moisture arriving in our region. </p>
<p>On Saturday night, a low-pressure center off the Pacific Northwest coast begins to gain influence, turning already light ridgeline winds more southerly. Drizzle will focus on areas of the central and northern Cascades favored by this flow pattern. As the trough approaches the coast on Sunday, SSW winds and some light rain and snow increase across the Puget Sound and should reach the Cascade Crest by the end of the day. Mt Baker can expect precipitation to start earlier in the day, but the timing remains uncertain. Snow levels in the 7,000-8,500 ft range can be expected through the weekend, with freezing levels reaching above 10,000 ft around Mt. Hood, before the arrival of late-day precipitation.</p>
<p>The elongated trough sends more of its energy southward toward California Saturday night and Sunday, but maintains cloud cover and relatively disorganized showers over our region, along with a subtle cooling trend. Snow levels are expected to drop to around 4,000-6,000 ft by the afternoon.</p>
