<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The front that brought our atmospheric river remains draped over the region and is drifting northward Friday through Friday night. The front is associated with a moist lower atmosphere, light to moderate ridgeline W or WSW winds, and a boundary between mild air to the north and unseasonably warm air to the south. </p>
<p>Periods of light rain and drizzle should generally end around Mt Rainier during the morning hours, with light precipitation continuing further north on Friday. Thanks to the depth of the moisture, some of that precipitation will continue to spill onto the east slopes of the Cascades. An inversion is likely to continue to bring some freezing rain or freezing drizzle to Washington Pass. Precipitation gradually decreases and ends by Saturday morning as winds ease overnight. A ridge of high pressure expands into the region on Saturday, pushing all precipitation north of the Canadian border, but leaving plenty of clouds over much of Washington State, particularly northern areas. Freezing levels will be in the 9000-12000 ft range on Saturday...truly balmy.</p>
