<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Moderate to heavy showers will continue to pepper the mountains this afternoon and evening before becoming lighter overnight.  Snow levels will fall to 3500-4000' over the north and central Cascades 5000-6000' for the south Cascades and Mt Hood.  There will be a convergence area that adds a few additional inches to the Cascades in Whatcom and Skagit counties tonight as well.  While snow at elevations that are currently bare will be welcome, the main story will be the ongoing extreme W-SW winds.  With saturated soils and many fallen trees over the past week, these high winds will batter all ridgelines and the east slopes of the Cascades in general for the better part of Monday night.  Refer to our friends at the NWS for statements on flooding and landslides. </p>
<p>We'll barely catch our brief Tuesday morning before the next pulse of warm frontal precipitation in a long drawn out atmospheric river event moves over the area.  The heavist precipitation will likely center on the central and northern WA Cascades during the day.  Winter will be short-lived as this pulse of moisture brings milder air with it, pushing snow levels back up above ski area bases and the major Passes during the day.  </p>
<p>A strong front will smash through the area Tuesday night, with another round of extreme winds and heavy precipitation. Snow levels will start high and cool significantly late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning following the frontal passage. We'll be in cool WNW flow on Wednesday with some of the lowest snow levels we've seen in some time, and consistent moderate snow showers to help build our snowpack. </p>
