<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A very wet and active weather pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest. The promised cool-down was slow to materialize Friday night, but snow levels are gradually lowering nonetheless. Heavy, wet snow continues Saturday for elevations above around 4000 ft throughout the region on Saturday, holding fairly steady throughout the day. The heaviest precipitation will be between Stevens Pass and the Canadian border Saturday morning, but it eases by the afternoon as moisture increases slightly further south. That slightly higher snow level cuts into expected snow totals at places like Stevens Pass, where most accumulations will be above the Pass. Extreme winds on Friday evening are gradually easing, but remain in the moderate to locally strong range for areas near and east of the Cascade Crest on Saturday. These winds will continue to ease through Saturday night as light rain and snow showers decrease, with little change in the snow level.</p>
<p>A warm front switches winds to the SSW on Sunday and brings in moderate rain and snow from south to north as the day progresses. Most areas should experience subtle warming as the day progresses. A brief period of little snow may very slightly delay the warming in the Passes, but there's just not much cold air to work with.</p>
