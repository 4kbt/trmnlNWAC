<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cool, snowy pattern has settled into the Pacific Northwest, replacing the warm conveyor of moisture that has drifted SE into southern Oregon. With a broad upper trough over the region, expect continued mostly moderate W and WSW ridgeline winds and snow to stack up. Snow showers will be locally intense throughout the Cascades. The atmospheric instability will help some of the moisture spill over onto the east slope of the Cascades. Snow amounts on Friday should be in the 4-10" range for areas near and west of the Cascade Crest, with 1-6" amounts further east. Winds will be plenty strong to blow around the low-density snow in exposed terrain.</p>
<p>Snow shower activity generally increases slightly Friday night and Saturday as the upper trough digs southward offshore. Winds gradually shift toward the SW, favoring the volcanoes and Mt. Baker slightly more over time. Most locations near and west of the Cascade Crest will pick up an additional 12-20" of snow Friday night through Saturday.</p>
<p>Snow levels remain low throughout the short-term forecast, generally in the 1000-2500 ft range.</p>
