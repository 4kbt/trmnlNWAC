<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Friday should be a quiet weather day ahead of a more complex and active weekend. A high pressure ridge passes over the region resulting in partly to mostly sunny skies along with bands of mid and high clouds. 5000 ft temperatures should top out in the mid 30's for most of our mountain areas. All in all, it should be a nice day. </p>
<p>As we head into the afternoon and evening, clouds increase, thicken, and lower.  A narrow atmospheric river (AR) then takes aim at Vancouver Island. The northwestern Olympics and North Cascades seem to sit right on the edge of the main precipitation band. Look for a few showers to develop around midnight, but precipitation will become more steady very early Saturday morning and throughout the day. The main axis of rain and snow appears to stall in the same location for about 30 hrs, but it won't take much of a shift in the exact position of this AR to radically change the forecast. </p>
<p>While most areas stay dry through Saturday, this storm will also drive increasing winds. Strong and gusty southerly winds will dominate locations near and north of Hwy 2, while places south will see increasingly strong W-SW winds. Cloudy and gusty conditions will describe most of our forecast region until the AR finally drifts south late Sunday. </p>
