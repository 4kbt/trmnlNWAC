<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Most locations are in for a cloudy, dry, and breezy day. A mild atmospheric river (AR), pointed at Vancouver Island, slowly drifts southward on Saturday.  This will bring rain and snow first to the Olympic Mountains and eventually to the West North zone. While precipitation totals aren't impressive during the day, the greater initial impacts come from moderate to strong and gusty ridgeline winds. While most areas should experience cloudy conditions, areas further east and south could see partly sunny skies with filtered sunshine. </p>
<p>The AR seems to sag even further south overnight, bringing rain and snow to the Central Cascades. However, the main focus of precipitation is quite narrow and sharp. This means, unless it's pointed right at you, you might not see much precipitation, and small shifts in its aim could have big impacts on water totals. There is quite a spread in the weather models as to the exact position of the rain/snow. Precipitation seems most certain for areas near and north of Hwy 2. Conversely, areas near and south of Hwy 12 should stay dry. Overnight snowlevels, tend to hover between 4500-5500 ft. </p>
<p>Precipitation lifts back northward on Sunday. This time period suffers from the same uncertainty due to the narrow band of intense rain/snow. Warmer air works its way into the region causing snowlevels to slowly but steadily climb throughout the day. Much like Saturday, areas further south and east stay dry and could experience more filtered sunshine. </p>
