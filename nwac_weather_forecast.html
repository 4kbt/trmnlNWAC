<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Drier conditions have moved into the region, even as the remnants of a stalled frontal boundary continue to linger overhead. Moisture is still being transported in on brisk upper-level winds, producing light to occasionally moderate rainfall. However, compared to what we’ve seen recently, totals will be measured in mere tenths—or even hundredths—of an inch, rather than inches.</p>
<p>The stalled front continues to focus on the central Washington Cascades through the evening hours, bringing light to occasionally moderate rainfall to that region. Precipitation decreases and shifts slightly northward overnight. Northern Washington remains cooler, so expect some middle-elevation snowfall accumulations (1-4") in the northern Cascades.</p>
<p>The gradual northward drift and further warming is expected on Friday. Precipitation essentially ends south of Snoqualmie Pas by the afternoon, but most areas remain cloudy. This trend continues on Friday night. By Saturday, the high-pressure ridge expands sufficiently as it moves inland over California to shift all of the moisture north of the Canadian border, leaving high freezing levels across the region and partly to mostly cloudy skies.</p>
