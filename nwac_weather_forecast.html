<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Light rain will brush the area today as a weakening frontal system dies over the area.  You're more likely to see some cloud breaks along the east slopes of the Cascades and the eastern side of Mt Hood today. Temperatures will be mild and snow levels will be in the 6500-7500' range with steady W-SW winds.   </p>
<p>Yet another atmospheric river is headed our way starting Sunday night and into next week.  Precipitation will really pick up during the day on Monday, especially for the central and north WA Cascades where 1-2 inches of liquid water is expected during the daylight hours.  W-SW winds will be strong to extreme, flooding warm air into the region.  While we're talking about rain at most locations and elevations that matter, the Washington Pass area and East North zone will be tricky, and snow levels may hang around 6000' until milder air arrives Monday afternoon. </p>
<p>Gradual cooling will start Monday night into Tuesday as additional waves of moisture arrive.  Get ready for another stormy week, albeit one that ends a lot cooler than we started.  </p>
