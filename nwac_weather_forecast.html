<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Although the most intense weather moved through Tuesday and Tuesday night, a cold, snowy pattern continues through Thursday across the Pacific Northwest. Snow levels have lowered to 1500-2000 ft by early Wednesday as vigorous snow shower activity continues (more focused on Washington than Oregon). Expect this activity to continue through around 10 AM Wednesday across the Cascades. A sharp comma-shaped front shifts winds more SSWerly in the mid-morning hours. This will provide a brief decrease in shower activity before a 1-2-hour period of heavy banded precipitation moves through in the midday hours. This precipitation is likely to be heaviest in the southern Washington Cascades and Mt Hood. Behind this front, winds shift back to WSW and then W and increase into the moderate range near and east of the Cascade Crest through Wednesday night. Expect a resulting increase in mountain-enhanced snow showers as these winds pick up. The convergence banding should enhance snowfall rates at times in the southern mountain loop and Stevens Pass area, but models no longer show strong agreement on the exact location of the banding.</p>
<p>Temperatures continue to drop through Thursday morning, bringing the coldest air of the week and snow levels lowering to sea level to 1000 ft during this time. Expect more moderate, low-density snow showers, but with slightly less intensity than on Wednesday and Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Expect an additional 1-2 ft of low-density snow for areas near and west of the Cascade Crest through Thursday.</p>
