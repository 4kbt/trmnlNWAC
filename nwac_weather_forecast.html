<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The second round of Friday's storm system is ramping up this afternoon across the region. Moderate to locally heavy rain and snow will develop and continue through the early evening hours.  Until a 7pm-ish frontal passage through the Cascades, snow levels will stay on the mild side, in the 3500-4500' range, even in the Cascade Passes. Strong W-SW winds will continue Friday night for most areas and slowly decrease during the day on Saturday.  </p>
<p>As we get later into Friday evening, the bottom will fall out for the snow levels as they come crashing towards sea-level by Saturday morning. Significant post-frontal showers will continue overnight, piling up additional snowfall, especially along the West slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood. A Puget Sound Convergence zone will likely produce locally heavy amounts of snow overnight in the Mtn Loop to Hwy20 West area.  A cold upper level low hanging offshore of central British Columbia's coast will direct showers into our region all day Saturday in cool westerly flow aloft.  These snow showers won't be quite as moisture-laden as Friday's storm, but we'll squeeze 1.5x to almost double the snow out of what you'd expect with a similar precipitation forecast under normal Cascadian winter temperatures. Storm totals from tonight through Saturday should total 6-18", with the highest amounts along the west slopes/near the Puget Sound Convergence zone and the lower end along the east slopes of the Cascades, especially further east of the Cascade crest due to downsloping/drying in westerly flow.  </p>
<p>We'll ramp down the winds and the snow showers a notch Saturday night and Sunday, but expect a few additional low-density inches during each 12-hr period. Mid-mountain temperatures will fall into the teens by Saturday morning with single digits common at upper elevations. Pack the right layers this weekend between the temperatures, new snow and the wind chill.  </p>
