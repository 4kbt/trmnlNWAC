<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weakening Pacific frontal system is slowing and splitting apart as it approaches the coastline this afternoon. Part of the frontal system will slide into OR/CA overnight, perhaps clipping the Mt Hood area with light showers. Further north over the Washington Cascades and Olympics, we'll be left with partly cloudy skies, with areas of low clouds concentrated along the eastern slopes of the Cascades and the eastern approaches for the major Passes.  While this system isn't much to look at, it will increase offshore gradients and bring about moderate SE ridgeline winds that drag colder air across the Cascades along with lowering freezing levels. Areas further west, such as the Mt Baker area, will remain milder overnight. </p>
<p>SE ridgeline winds will peak before sunrise, and then should back off and eventually become WSW in the afternoon as a longwave upper level trough passes through. This upper level feature should spread light showers throughout the area, and more uniformity in the snow levels over the mountains (3500-4500').  A few leftover showers may linger into Thursday night. </p>
<p>A stronger system will approach on Friday.  This frontal system will be slow to spread precipitation inland, with light warm frontal precipitation moving over the Cascades later in the day. Strong S-SE ridgeline winds may really start to crank by the afternoon...there are still questions about the strength and timing with this system.  We'll see relatively higher snow levels, although not too high, west of the Cascade crest on Friday vs areas further east. </p>
