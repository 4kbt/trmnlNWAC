<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">A broad trough over most of Canada and the northern United States will maintain below-normal temperatures at all elevations in our region. If you head into the mountains, bring some extra layers.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">A shortwave disturbance riding down the back of the broader trough guides a surface low toward the mouth of the Columbia River, arriving around midnight. Initially isolated snow showers over the Olympics and southern Cascade Volcanoes region during the late evening hours will become scattered and expand northward overnight. Light to moderate snow shower activity peaks during the daylight hours on Saturday. Models struggle to define the probable location and strength of a convergence band developing in the central Washington Cascades Saturday afternoon. Once this band forms, it should ease southward toward the Mt Rainier area during the evening as precipitation comes to an end across the region. </span><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Expect low-density storm snow totals of 3-8” for the west slopes of the Cascades from the Mountain Loop to Mt Hood, with 1-3” elsewhere. Snow levels peak Saturday afternoon around sea level in the north and 1500 ft in the south. Ridgeline winds will be most impactful for Mt Hood where they will remain in the moderate range for much of the storm.</span></p>
<p>Some lingering clouds, flurries, and very weak convergence activity remain for the west slopes of the Cascades under NW flow aloft on Sunday. Temperatures should be comparable to Saturday but might start the colder east of the Cascades where skies are mostly clear.</p>
