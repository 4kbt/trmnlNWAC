<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's another balmy start to a mid-winter's day with mountain temperatures in the 40s and even 50s this morning, and freezing levels between 11,000-13,000' across the region. Low stratus clouds are mired in the western Washington lowlands and banked up against the west slopes of the Cascades. Low clouds and fog are patchier near the Cascade Passes and along the east slopes of the Cascades valleys than on the west side.  No matter which side you approach the mountains from, you'll need sunscreen and fewer layers than you would typically wear in mid-January. </p>
<p>A weak weather disturbance currently over Vancouver Island will not bring precipitation, but will push some high clouds  the North Cascades and Olympics later this afternoon, along with a subtle cooling trend.  W-NW winds will also kick up with this feature late this afternoon and overnight, with ridgeline winds rising into the moderate range. Freezing levels will dip ever so slightly tonight. </p>
<p>The upper level ridge will rebuild along the west coast on Thursday.  Freezing levels will once again rebound to 11,000-12,000'.  The biggest change for Thursday will be felt with mid-mountain temperatures that will trend a bit cooler, generally in the 40s vs 50s. Also, east winds will start to develop in the Passes Thursday afternoon as offshore flow begins to ramp up. </p>
