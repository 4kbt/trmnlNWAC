<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is off to a chilly start on Friday. A cold trough sits over the area, but with cold air at the surface, instability is limited at this point. Therefore, we expect mostly sunny skies north of I-90 for much of the day. However, a system tracking from Idaho into Montana has brought light snowfall into the southern Cascades. Along the east slopes that extends from Blewett Pass southward and from Mt Rainier southward for the west slopes. NE ridgeline winds should switch west by late morning and gradually increase as the system exits, helping switch the focus of the snowfall primarily to the southern Cascade Volcanoes by the afternoon as a very weak shortwave moves over the area. Low-density accumulations should be less than 3" in all areas.</p>
<p>A stronger shortwave approaches the area overnight, sliding down the back side of the trough. Light snow showers increase for the west slopes of the southern Washington Cascades and Olympics, potentially becoming moderate for the volcanoes by morning. The light to moderate snow showers spread throughout the Cascades on Saturday. Expect 2-8" of low-density snow (with up to 0.3" of water equivalent) for most areas, with the highest amounts likely for Snoqualmie Pass and Paradise. Expect light to moderate WSW winds to focus more on the southern half of the Cascades.</p>
