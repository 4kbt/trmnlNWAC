<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The first wave in what will feel like an endless stream of clouds and precipitation started earlier today. Waves of moisture will ride up and over a strong ridge of high pressure parked offshore, keeping the mositure tap pointed at us, but never allowing us to cool down too much in this pattern.</p>
<p>Light to locally moderate precipitation is evenly distributed from north to south this afternoon, but a secondary impluse of warm frontal precipitation will take aim further south tonight, especially near Mt Hood. Heavy precipitation is expected on the southern volcanoes, including Mt Rainier, St Helens, Adams, and especially Mt Hood through Friday. Precipitation will spread back north on Friday. Unfortunately, this will come with a warming trend. Snow levels that had hovering around 4000' in the north, 5000' in the central and south WA Cascades and 7000' near Mt Hood will rise later tonight through Friday, pushing rain to higher trailheads and Passes.  </p>
<p>The trailing low pressure system will pass into central British Columbia Friday night and we'll see continued light to locally moderate precipitation. This time the focus will be on the west north and west central areas along the west slopes of the Cascades. Snow levels will slide lower Friday night and Saturday, bringing snow back to the Mt Baker area and Stevens Pass trailheads.  </p>
<p>A near constant feature over this stretch will be the strong W-NW winds, most pronounced along higher ridgelines and above.  Winds will be strongest from the central Cascades and south to Mt Hood, and we should see periods of extreme winds over the next 48 hours.  A byproduct of the constant and strong NW flow aloft will be a strong drying trend, and downsloping over the east slopes of the Cascades. Look for precipitation totals to trail off signficantly the futher east one travels from the Cascade crest. </p>
