<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">A narrow cold front is making landfall this afternoon and will push into the west slopes of the Cascades by 3 pm or so. Cloud cover has increased ahead of the front, as have gusty southwesterly winds. Mountain temperatures are downright balmy in the 40’s and 50’s, and thus most of the precipitation will fall as rain except for the highest elevations. Even there, snow accumulation should be quite modest as there just isn’t much to this front. A slight chance of thunder remains for the West North during frontal passage around 4 or 5 pm. Temperatures will plummet this evening and overnight with some very weak post-frontal banding taking aim at the West Central and West North Zones, with a weak wave this evening and another early through mid-morning Friday. With snow levels dropping to 3000ft, those zones could pick up a few inches of snow, but even in the bullseye, totals aren’t impressive.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Conditions remain cool on Friday as an upper-level trough sits offshore. Wind speeds continue to decline and most areas stay relatively dry, save for a spotty snow shower or two. Any precipitation that does fall during the day should be in the form of snow down to all trailhead elevations, but we don’t expect additional accumulations during the bulk of the day. Expect a mix of clouds and sun, with more sunshine south and east.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The trough moves overhead Friday night into Saturday morning as light snowfall becomes more widespread, continuing through the day before tapering in the evening. It will be a cool day with sunbreaks possible on the mid and upper slopes, especially east and south. Again, snow totals are meager. Skies should clear overnight to Sunday, as an upper-level ridge starts to build.</p>
