<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Our weather pattern shouldn't change too much Friday night and Saturday as the PNW stays sandwiched between the jet stream to our north and a cut-off low pressure meandering around California. Places where it's been cloudy and rainy continue to be cloudy and rainy. Areas with clearer skies will remain sunnier. That dividing line seems to be somewhere in the central Cascades, with precipitation confined to the Olympics and North Cascades. The further south you go, the more sunshine and fewer clouds you find.</p>
<p>That all starts to change late Saturday afternoon as a storm approaches our region. Clouds should begin to increase, thicken, and lower late in the day. Precipitation, however, holds off for most areas until after midnight or even early Sunday morning. With warm air in place, this storm starts as rain for most trailheads. </p>
<p>The storm intensifies Sunday morning, with gustier winds and heavier precipitation. This will help rain and high elevation snow to spill over the Cascade crest to areas further east. While there is some cooling with the system, we won't really see snow levels drop until the cold front finally swings through the region in the afternoon. As it does so, temperatures quickly fall, eventually bringing snow below pass levels sometime Sunday night. </p>
