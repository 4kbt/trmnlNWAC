<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper level ridge of high pressure will slide over our area tonight. On Friday, the upper level ridge will start to flatten, opening the door for increasing amounts of mid and high clouds in westerly flow aloft. Most areas will still see a fair amount of sunshine, but the skies should mostly cloud up over the northwest Cascades and Olympics before sunset. Freezing levels and afternoon high temperatures should be slightly warmer on Friday, rising to 5000-6500' across the region. </p>
<p>The forecast had us living on the edge of an atmospheric river boundary for the upcoming weekend, and the latest forecast model solutions are coming into agreement that the frontal boundary delivering moisture to our northern neighbors will dip into our region starting Saturday.  Rain and snow and strong southerly winds should develop early Saturday morning for the Olympics and northwest Cascade including the Mt Baker area with precipitation tapering later in the day as the frontal boundary lifts back north into B.C. Snow levels will like hold around 3500-4500' in the morning and rise to 4000-5000' as precipitation tapers off.  Very light precipitation is possible for the central Washington Cascades with drier conditions further south. While areas not receiving precipitation will have higher freezing levels, expect windy conditions and mostly cloudy skies to negate some of the higher freezing levels. </p>
