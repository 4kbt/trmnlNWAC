<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Our region transitions into an atmospheric river pattern as we head from Saturday afternoon onwards.</p>
<p>In the interim, temperatures are above average, with most NWAC stations in the 30s as of Thursday afternoon. A weak upper-level front moves east of the area by Thursday evening, allowing the region to dry out. A more meaningful warm front brings light rain and snow into northern Washington in the early morning hours on Friday, which increases through the morning hours. Light to moderate rain and snow increases through the afternoon as a cold front approaches. S flow has the potential to bring a period of strong winds to the Mt Baker area in the mid-day and afternoon hours. E-flow should keep the passes cooler, but expect a wintry mix for the lower mountain passes in the afternoon and evening hours as pre-frontal flow switches post-frontal but without a low-level wind shift. Moderate post-frontal showers become light Friday night, with a relative break in the action early Saturday morning.Â </p>
<p>Rain and snow become moderate to heavy in the afternoon as strong SW winds bring increasingly mild air associated with the first significant wave of a series comprising an atmospheric river event. Snow levels should rise from 4500-6000 ft in the morning to 5500-7000 ft in the afternoon. The strong winds will scour most of the remaining cold pool east of the Cascades.</p>
