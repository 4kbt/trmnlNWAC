<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a brief warm-up late Thursday, we'll be in a prime snow accumulation pattern. A moisture-laden frontal system continues to impact the region with the full array of winter weather, including heavy snow, heavy rain, and possibly freezing rain. The core of the moisture and warm sector is directed from the mouth of Columbia to Mt Rainier and southward as of Thursday afternoon, but plenty of moisture (and a brief warm-up) is spilling north of that boundary as well. With low-level E flow until about 6 PM, we're expecting a brief period of freezing rain before a changeover to rain at Snoqualmie Pass and most locations near and west of the Cascade Crest, up to around 5000 ft in the north and 6000-7000 ft in the south. As the front drags southeast, expect cooler air to return. A secondary front moving through around 8 PM should bring an uptick in rain/snow shower activity in the late evening hours and is likely to trigger convergence, initially over the Mountain Loop, then the Stevens Pass area overnight.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, most areas will see snow levels steady around 1000-2000 ft with light snow showers becoming moderate in the afternoon. Moderate snow showers continue on WSW flow through Saturday with a very subtle increase in snow level, but snow levels should remain below all major passes.</p>
