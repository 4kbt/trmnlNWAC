<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The last act of the Christmas-Boxing day storm brings more heavy snowfall in addition to moderate to strong SSW ridgeline switching W in the mid-day hours. The low center tracks ENE from the central Puget Sound toward the mountain loop. This more southerly track has decreased the ridgeline wind forecast for the Olympics, Mt Baker, and Washington Pass areas to moderate (previously strong). A low-level shift to W winds coincides with the westerly push in the late morning hours and should raise snow levels to around 3500 ft for all areas. This won't change snow levels appreciably west of the Cascade Crest, but should result in a snow-to-rain transition for Snoqualmie Pass and low-elevation locations east of the Cascade Crest. Moisture wrapping around the low remains stratiform and steady. The back edge of this precipitation shield has reached the coast. As the package shifts eastward, we'll see a transition to a more showery regime in the Olympics by mid-day and in the Cascades during the afternoon.Â </p>
<p>Shower activity continues on W flow Thursday evening before a weaker system arrives with moderate rain and snow arriving from SW to NE. This starts overnight for Mt Hood and the Olympics, and during the morning hours on Friday for the central Washington Cascades. This system may or may not reach as far north as the North Cascades. Expect another shift from E to W winds during the mid-day hours switching pass-level precipitation at Snoqualmie from snow to rain.</p>
