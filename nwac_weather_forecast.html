<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A complex system will impact the region through the weekend. The weekend starts with a moisture-laden frontal system passing over the southern Puget Sound to Mt Baker and dropping SE. Out ahead of this front, expect heavy rain, high-elevation snow, and freezing rain at low elevations east of the Cascade Crest and through Snoqualmie Pass. Behind this front, ridgeline winds switch from SW to W and low-level pressure gradients switch W as well, switching freezing rain to rain at the Passes. A second frontal passage late Saturday will re-invigorate rain and snow through the afternoon as a converge band forms in the mountain loop late in the day then drops south toward Stevens Pass. It could impact Stevens for a long period during the evening and possibly the overnight hours.</p>
<p>Snow levels start dropping rapidly behind the initial frontal passage early Saturday, but they have a lot of ground to cover as they start around 9000 ft this morning. By the afternoon, they should be in the 4500 to 6500 ft range, dropping further to around 3000 ft overnight where they remain through Sunday.</p>
<p>An upper low brings the final act. This low will bring banded and locally heavy rain and snow as it drops SE into the region, overnight through Sunday. Precipitation should taper from N to south as the day progresses. This will bring 6-12" of snow to the west slopes of the Cascades.</p>
