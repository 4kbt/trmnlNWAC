<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest remains in a prolonged dry spell.</p>
<p>While the coldest temperatures at mid and upper elevations likely occurred last Friday, gradually increasing light to moderate E flow continues to strengthen the low-level cold pool east of the Cascades through Sunday night and Monday. This will lead to strong temperature contrasts across the region as the offshore ridge drifts eastward into our region by late Monday as it gradually flattens. The result will be very cold overnight temperatures east of the Cascade Crest and early Monday, so bundle up! The low-level E flow through the mountain gaps will decrease the wind chill further and these winds should peak mid-day on Monday. Low temperatures should be in the single digits and 10s in these locations with strong temperature inversions focusing the coldest air at pass level and in deep valley locations. Further west, 5000 ft temperatures will be in the upper 10s to mid-20s. Temperatures will rebound sharply in areas less exposed to the influence of the cold pool by the afternoon. Areas like Mt St Helens may see freezing levels rise above 8500 ft while Crystal Mountain might not see any above-freezing temperatures. The Olympics will see the warmest temperatures in the region.</p>
<p>Monday night brings a band of mid-level clouds as a shortwave trough approaches. This should reduce radiational cooling, resulting in a more moderate night of temperatures than we've seen. A switch to W winds should also help moderate temperatures E of the Cascades. The shortwave should cool temperatures west of the Cascade Crest on Tuesday and bring a period of moderate ridgeline winds for Mt Hood, the mountain gaps, and the east slopes of the Cascades.</p>
