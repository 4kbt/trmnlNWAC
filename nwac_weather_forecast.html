<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in store for dry and increasingly warm weather over the next few days, and perhaps through the weekend as an upper level ridge of high pressure takes control over the area.</p>
<p>After a cold start this morning, freezing levels will quickly rise with mid-mountain high temperatures reaching the low to mid-40s over the Olympics, Mt Hood, and areas west of the Cascade crest. Temperatures will still rise but will be relatively cooler than the west side in the Cascade Passes, particularly Stevens, and along the east slopes of the Cascades from I-90 and northward. On top of that, we'll see light to moderate S-SE winds in many areas today. Skies will be mostly sunny but expect a few high clouds this afternoon. </p>
<p>A weak weather disturbance passing inland to our north will temporarily flatten the ridge overnight through Thursday morning. This will keep a patchwork of high clouds in the forecast and allow ridgeline wind speeds to tick up over the Olympics and WA Cascades. While freezing levels will more or less hold steady on Thursday, mid-mountain temperatures will warm a few degrees tomorrow with the westerly flow, especially in the Passes and along the east slopes of the Cascades relative to Wednesday. </p>
