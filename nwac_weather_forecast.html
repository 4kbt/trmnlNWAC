<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A pair of low pressure centers located over south-central Washington and northern Oregon are quickly moving east. With it, a band of heavy stratiform precipitation shifted east of Mt Hood. A band of moderate to locally heavy rain and snow will linger over the central Washington Cascades and could bring 3-6" snow to Snoqualmie Pass, Salmon La Sac, Blewett Pass, and Mission Ridge before it exits eastward.</p>
<p>The next low tracks toward British Columbia. Hot on the heels of the departing system, the next round arrives in the afternoon hours. Precipitation will spread into the region from the southwest, particularly for the west slopes of the southern and central Cascades. This rain and snow could be moderate by the end of the day. Moderate rain and snow impacts the region overnight ahead of a frontal passage on Saturday morning with moderate to locally heavy rain and snow and a slight increase in snow levels from around 2500-3000 ft Friday and Friday night to 3000-4000 ft on Saturday. Snoqualmie Pass likely experiences snow levels jumping above the Pass with an E to W low-level wind shift.</p>
<p>The west slopes of the Cascades above the rain-snow line can expect 6-20" over the period, with the highest amounts at Paradise, Mt Hoodm Mt Baker, and Washington Pass.</p>
