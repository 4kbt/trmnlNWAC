<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A low pressure system will track along the coast-line this morning and over the northern Inland waters of western WA this afternoon.  The low pressure is unlikley to be as deep or powerful as previous forecasts suggested, so while mountain winds will still be strong in many areas today, they won't be as strong as forecast yesterday.  Moderate to strong E-SE winds this morning will become S-SW mid to late afternoon.  A warm front has brought rising snow levels near and west of the Cascade crest this morning, and snow levels should peak at 5000-5500' mid-day to early this afternoon for the entirety of the WA Cascades, before falling back to 4500' with the wind shift later this afternoon.  </p>
<p>More moderate precipitation, locally heavy in the Mt Baker area this afternoon, should stretch across the north Cascades as a warm frontal boundary stalls out.  Precipitation will become lighter generally south, outside scattered afternoon showers mainly affecting the SW Cascades and Mt Hood. </p>
<p>Showers will quickly fade this evening, and winds will ease.  On Christmas Day, we'll see a similar but weaker upper-level disturbance pass from south to north over the area, and another round of moderate E-SE winds and generally light precipitation. Snow levels will be in the 3500-5000' range.  </p>
