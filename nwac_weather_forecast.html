<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A complex storm system will impact the Pacific Northwest today, bringing something we haven't seen in awhile - precipitation.  The first frontal wave is passing through this morning with some intense snowfall rates with snow levels around 3000', except a bit warmer for Mt Hood and the Olympics.  By late morning through mid-day we should see snowfall rates decrease with a break in the heavier precipitation.  A secondary upper level feature rounding the base of a broad upper level trough over the NE Pacific will reinvigorate precipitation this afternoon through this evening. The catch will be slightly warmer snow levels in the 3500-4500' for most areas that extends into the early evening.  Snow fall looks to be heaviest along the west slopes of the Cascades tonight in Snohomoish and Skagit and perhaps part of Whatcom County thanks to the additional lift associated with a Puget Sound Convergence Zone. With strong W-SW flow and ridgeline winds, you should expect to see snowfall totals taper off rapidly the further east of the Cascade crest you get in this pattern. </p>
<p>After this secondary feature passes through the Cascades Friday evening we'll see snow levels start to plummet after midnight.  Look for post-frontal snow showers to continue Friday night and Saturday as much colder air settles into the region and we enter an unstable, convective weather pattern that supports showers. Snow levels will start to fall to near sea-level and even though we'll see the precipitiation forecast decrease relative to today, we'll squeeze out more and fluffier snowfall at these colder temperatures. </p>
