<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The mountain weather forecast has launched for the 2025-26 season as a modest atmospheric river continues to bring plenty of rainfall to the region on Friday. The moisture feed is associated with a stalled frontal boundary tapping into from aclosed low off the California Coast. A shift from SW to W winds ahead of a subtle trough lowered snow levels to around 4000-5000 ft over the northern Cascades and Olympics. Snow levels remain in the 5500-6500 ft range within the heaviest moisture plume aimed from Snoqualmie Pass to the Mountain Loop. Subtle troughing transitions to subtle ridgeing, resulting in a warming trend Friday night. Moderate to heavy rain and higher elevation snow continue for the west slopes of the Cascades with some spillover to the lee of the Cascades as the moisture feed broadens and de-intensifies and moderate ridgeline winds continue in exposed terrain.</p>
<p>Light to moderate rain and higher-elevation snow decrease on Saturday as spillover onto the east slopes of the Cascades also decreases throughout the day. Snow levels hover around 7000 ft in the north and 9000 ft in the south. Moderate ridgeline winds near and east of mountain gaps become mostly light from mid-morning onward.</p>
<p>An elongated trough approaching the coast will keep periods of light rain and high-elevation snow in the forecast through Saturday night and Sunday with a slight cooling trend. Low-level easterly flow could keep the passes slightly cooler than areas further west.</p>
