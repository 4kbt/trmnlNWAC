<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>430PM Update: </strong> Increased West North/East North Snow levels for Thursday afternoon and Evening</p>
<p>Snow showers will continue this afternoon and evening, adding a few inches of snow mainly along the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes.  The extreme westerly winds from this morning have tapered down, and will further ease tonight. However, there will be no break in the action.  A juicy frontal system will combine with a cool upper-level trough in the NE Pacific to bring renewed precipitation on Thursday. </p>
<p>All areas will see significant rain and snow, but the heaviest precipitation will develop in the morning over the Mt Hood area along a warm frontal boundary and move northward and inland during the day.  The southern volcanoes in our forecast area (Mt Hood, St Helens and Mt Adams) should see 2-3" of water today, and again Wednesday night.  Strong WSW flow will pump milder air into the southwest WA Cascades and Mt Hood, turning snow back to rain at lower and mid-elevations.  With cool easterly flow, Snoqualmie Pass has a good chance of a few hours of freezing rain mid to late afternoon, before the snow level rises well above Pass level in the early evening.  The warm air should eventually push 5-6000' snow levels into the central Cascades late Thursday afternoon and to around 5000' into the North Cascades Thursday evening. Extreme winds will also rake the areas with the highest precipitation forecasts through Thursday night. </p>
<p>On Friday, we'll be left in a cool snow showery pattern and be back to stacking up several inches of fresh snow.   </p>
