<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An atmospheric river has narrowed with the E-W axis of moisture lingering over central and northern Washington. This will bring generally moderate precipitation to the west slopes of the Cascades through the day, with moisture gradually decreasing in southern portions of the forecast region by the afternoon as a ridge begins to expand northward. This will also continue to in further elevate snow lines within the 5500-8500 ft range (cooler in the north). Winds continue to decrease with ridgeline areas favored by W flow in the moderate range.</p>
<p>Precipitation mostly ends from Mt Rainier southward Monday evening and becomes light further north. In these areas snow lines will be 7000-8000 ft.</p>
<p>Tuesday will be mostly dry under the influence of the ridge of high pressure. Expect sunny skies with 8500-11000 ft freezing levels over most of the forecast region. Some clouds and showers will linger near the Canadian border in the morning hours.</p>
