<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>This week won't feel very much like January. A few very light lingering rain and snow showers are the remnants of dissipating post-frontal flow Sunday evening. Expect a dusting of snow in some areas above the 4000-5000 ft rain/snow line. Meanwhile, a compact surface low associated with a weak open trough fends off the amplifying ridge for the next 24 hours as it reaches the coast during the evening hours. Most models show a compact shield of precipitation impacting areas primarily south of the OR/WA border, but cloud cover will extend north as far as the central Washington Cascades. Since Mt Hood is on the edge of the precipitation shield, it could get anywhere from around 0-.25" of precipitation with a 5000 ft snow line. As the low passes, generally light E or SE ridgeline winds should continue through Monday for Mt Hood.</p>
<p>Skies clear Sunday night through Monday morning from north to south. After a cool start in some valleys east of the Cascade Crest, expect temperatures to rise rapidly as the pronounced ridge moves into our nearshore waters. By Monday night the ridge moves onshore and gradually flattens ahead of a weakening system approaching from the NW Tuesday afternoon. By Monday, freezing levels near and west of the Cascade Crest rise to 6000-8000 ft, and by Tuesday afternoon they rise to 10,000 ft in most areas. Expect low-level inversions to bring below-freezing temperatures and fog to valley locations, particularly east of the Cascade Crest and through the mountain gaps, Monday night and Tuesday morning.</p>
