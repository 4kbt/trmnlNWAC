<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a pretty quiet start across most of the forecast region this morning. An offshore trough will split in half today sending the bulk of the system south to California. The leftover short wave system will push into the PNW today but it won't be in much of a hurry. Sunday, most of the precipitation will focus on the North Cascades in the morning. Expect stormy conditions with periods of heavy rain/snow and strong and gusty winds. As the system slowly starts to move, the stormy weather will spread into the Olympics and Mountain Loop Highway areas. A few showers could make their way to Wa Pass, Stevens Pass, and Snoqualmie Pass late in the afternoon, but most other areas should stay dry. Even if you don't see any precipitation during the day, you'll notice the increasing clouds and gusty winds. The strongest wind speeds should focus on Hurricane Ridge, Mt Baker, Mt Saint Helens, and Mt Hood during the day. </p>
<p>As we head into the evening, precipitation continues to spread south and east. A cold front will bring a concentrated several hours of precipitation that easily spills over to the eastern forecast zones. As temperatures cool, snow should quickly return to the Passes. The heavier precipitation doesn't last long. The system shifts east of the mountains, precipitation turns showery, and winds start to decrease. A short-lived Puget Sound Convergence Zone could form overnight and target Stevens and possibly Snoqualmie Pass. </p>
<p>Lingering low level moisture and onshore flow should keep the western zones and passes cloudy for most of Monday with a few light showers. However, weak zonal flow will allow for drier air to settle into the region. While we should see showers quickly coming to a close and clouds breaking, it doesn't look like we go full "bluebird." Our next system should arrive Tuesday. </p>
