<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The weather varies greatly this morning from north to south and east to west across our forecast region. Some locations are downright stormy, while others are very pleasant.</p>
<p>Bands of precipitation continue to target areas near and south of I-90 with the stormiest weather on Mt Rainier, Mt Saint Helens, and Mt Hood. This pattern should continue throughout the day. In these locations expect periods of moderate snow and stronger winds. Snoqualmie Pass will sit right on the northern edge of the main focus of precipitation making it less clear just how stormy it will be. Look for all the passes to slowly warm this morning as easterly flow quickly weakens and turns west. While Stevens and White Passes should stay all snow, Snoqualmie should switch to rain mid-morning. Elsewhere in the region, cloudy skies, occasional showers, and generally light winds will be the norm. </p>
<p>Showers taper off this evening as a transient high pressure ridge starts to approach the coast. Precipitation will hold on the longest in the southern forecast zones and on Mt Hood, but overall the trend will be for drying. Low level moisture should maintain cloudy skies unless you make it higher on one of the volcanoes. </p>
<p>The ridge approaches and passes overhead on Tuesday. With lingering moisture trapped at lower elevations, it could be a bit drippy in the morning, but there shouldn't be much in the way of real showers. By the afternoon we'll start a short 12-hour dry spell ahead of our next storm system. </p>
