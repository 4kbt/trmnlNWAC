<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The tail end of last night's atmospheric river will continue to deliver moderate to locally heavy precipitation across the west slopes of the Cascades south of Hwy 2 to Mt Hood through this morning, with lighter rain/snow elsewhere. Snow levels have dipped down to 4000' in the north Cascades, 5000/5500' in the central/south Cascades and 7000-7500' for Mt Hood. </p>
<p>After a bit of a lull later this morning, we'll see another round of heavier precipitation mid-day into the afternoon as a new frontal wave pushes into the area.  The heaviest precipitation during the daylight hours will once again be focused on the south/central WA Cascades and Mt Hood with lighter amounts further north and east. Snow levels will rise about 500-1000' vs this morning. The front will lift through Sunday evening, spreading heavier precipitation further north.  Look for very strong to extreme W-SW winds later this afternoon and evening with this feature.  </p>
<p>We'll see a bit of a break in the action late tonight through Monday morning as snow levels fall to around 3500', with milder snow levels for Mt Hood.  A warm front will lift through mid-day Monday and Monday afternoon, bringing a new round of light to moderate precipitation with a potential bullseye for the south WA Cascades. Snow levels will be a bit cooler with this system, so we can look forward to more mid-elevation snow than rain. </p>
