<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A front remains stalled off the Pacific Northwest coastline on Tuesday as a low develops along it and tracks towards our nearshore waters. This will leave most of our region relatively dry within the warm sector. The exception will be light rain and snow continuing over the Olympics and the Mt Baker area throughout the day, along with mostly cloudy skies to other areas. The best chance of more significant clearing will be during southern portions of the forecast region during the mid-day hours. Late in the day, light rain and snow spread throughout the Cascades. SW winds gradually shift more southerly as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Light to occasionally moderate rain and snow increase Tuesday night as the offshore low tracks toward Vancouver Island. With light (but not cold) E low-level flow, snow levels should be near Snoqualmie Pass elevation.</p>
<p>Snow levels rise up to 3000-4000 ft as the front moves onshore on Wednesday with continued light to moderate rain and snow. Expect some cooling in for the Olympics and then the Cascades late in the day.</p>
