<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Cold and mostly clear weather will continue through Wednesday.  We are on the backside of an upper level trough with northerly flow aloft.  While most areas are experiencing light to occasionally moderate winds, stronger N-NE winds (stronger at upper elevations) will continue closer to the Canadian border through tonight.  </p>
<p>Mountain temperatures will dip down into the single digits with a few below zero temperatures likely once again in a few spots. We'll start to see a bit of an east-west divide temperature-wise on Wednesday with areas further west of the Cascade crest warming into the mid/upper 20s, while near the crest and further east, max temperatures will largely stay in the teens.  </p>
<p>Upper level ridging will move over the area Wednesday night but will be short-lived as a slow moving low pressure system off the California coast slowly approaches us. We'll start to see SE winds increase for Mt Hood/West South and Snoqualmie Wednesday afternoon, with more widespread and strong SE winds peaking Thursday morning. The wind chills Wednesday night into Thursday morning will be very cold. This event will feature more wind than snow but a weak occluded front will bring some light snow to the central/south WA Cascades area on Thursday.  </p>
