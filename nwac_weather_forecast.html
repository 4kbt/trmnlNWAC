<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><strong>Fixed omission of wind speed for the Olympics on Wednesday night. No other changes were made.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Warm temperatures, plenty of sun breaks, and light winds were the story across much of the mountains on Wednesday as we sat under a short-lived upper-level ridge. The ridge shifts east tonight while cloud cover keeps overnight temperatures warm. Freezing levels continue to climb, reaching their apex sometime on Thursday morning, as the next system approaches the coastline. This one is warm, narrow, and fast-moving. A stray rain shower may pop up out ahead of the main band, but the bulk of the precipitation looks to start up around 2 or 3 pm, and most of the action is over by 7 or 8 with the frontal passage. It’s a modest storm at best, and snow levels during much of the precipitation look to be in the 5000-7000ft range, meaning this won't produce much in the way of accumulating snow except at the higher elevations. Even there, totals should be relatively meager. The exception will be areas favored by convergence Thursday night into Friday morning. As of now, it looks like somewhere in the Stevens Pass to Mtn Loop to Mount Baker area should get the bullseye, but we will have to sort that out tomorrow. Temperatures cool rapidly in all zones after the front passes through late Thursday night as breezy westerly flow increases. Friday looks cool with mostly to partly cloudy skies, but aside from a stray shower or two, things stay mostly dry as we wait for an upper-level trough to push overhead late Friday into Saturday.</p>
