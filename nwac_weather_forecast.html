<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>While the current weather system hasn't brought the extreme winds some earlier forecasts suggested, expect moderate to strong S-SW winds over the next few hours as the weakening surface low moves north of the border. Snow levels will have peaked in the 5000-5500' range earlier this afternoon and begin to fall to 3500-4500' late afternoon/early evening.  Unfortunately, showers will rapidly taper off this evening as upper-level ridging temporarily builds over the area. The dry weather won't last long as an upper low sends another wave of precipitation our way on Christmas.  However, this won't feel much like a gift for winter recreation, with generally light precipitation and freezing/snow levels higher than we'd typically expect for winter.  </p>
<p>Light precipitation will work its way from Mt Hood Thursday morning and expand northward across both sides of the WA Cascades during the day. There will be a brief bout of E-SE winds morning, but lower max speeds than on Wednesday. The W-E axis of precipitation will hang around the north Cascades Christmas afternoon. We may see showers linger well into Thursday night along that boundary, producing a few more inches of snow, particularly for the Baker area. </p>
<p>A pattern change will start later Thursday night as a cool upper level trough migrates southward and pushes an upper trough through on Friday.  Snow levels will fall to their coolest levels since earlier in the week (2500-3500'), and we'll see modest snow accumulation begin for the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes.  Westerly winds should become strong by the end of the day in this pattern. </p>
