<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal system is beginning to undercut a strong ridge of high pressure that's been positioned over our area for several days.  We won't see any precipitation today, but we will see a steady dose of high and mid clouds, with the opportunity for some filtered sunshine at times. Ridgeline winds have kicked up to moderate in most areas and should stay there for most of the day.  Freezing levels have lowered relative to the last few days but will hang around 7000'.  We'll continue to see low level inversions with areas of stratus and fog along the east slopes of the Cascades and up the Cascade Passes, squeezing through the Pass for Snoqualmie. </p>
<p>Offshore easterly flow will increase tonight and we'll see cold air dragged west of the Cascade crest, lowering freezing levels in the process and leading to moderate SE winds in many locations.  The remnants of the front in the form of longwave upper level trough will pass through on Thursday, bringing about a chance for some light showers, especially for Mt Hood and the southern Olympics. </p>
