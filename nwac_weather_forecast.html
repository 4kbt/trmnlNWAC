<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a period of high pressure and quiet weather an upper level ridge centered offshore extends over the southern half of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest.  That doesn't mean we won't have a few caveats to go along with the dry weather.  Cloud cover-wise we'll have a band of high clouds passing through this morning (along with localized areas of fog) giving way to mostly sunny skies late morning through early afternoon.  Then some high clouds will filter back in for the afternoon before sunset over WA state. </p>
<p>Freezing levels are on the rise, but while this ridge of high pressure will usher in milder weather, closer to the Canadian border especially for the West North zone, freezing levels will be slower to rise today and even on Tuesday.  Temperatures will hew closely to the freezing mark today and you'll find deeper inversions and colder temps below 5500' for Stevens Pass and along the east slopes of the Cascades in general.  </p>
<p>With the upper level ridge somewhat flattened and waves of moisture passing into northern B.C., all areas we'll see moderate NW ridgeline winds for good chunks of time that approach strong if you climb in elevation into the alpine.   </p>
