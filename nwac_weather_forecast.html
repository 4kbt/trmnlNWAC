<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Conditions are already changing across the forecast region Saturday afternoon as a storm begins to move into the region. Overnight, a frontal system will slowly drift southward from Canada, spreading precipitation throughout the area. It may be well after midnight or even early Sunday morning before rain and snow arrive in the Southern and Mt Hood forecast zones. Temperatures are mild, with most of our mountain weather stations reporting readings in the mid-30s to low-40s. Don't look for temperatures to fluctuate more than a few degrees overnight and into Sunday. As a result, this storm will start as rain for all but the highest trailheads. </p>
<p>On Sunday, the focus of the precipitation slowly shifts south and east. A cold front pushing inland later in the day will cause two notable impacts. 1. It will bring a more concentrated round of showers primarily to the west slopes of the Cascades. And, 2. temperatures finally cool and snow levels drop. Snow should fall below all pass levels Sunday evening. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone appears to form Sunday evening between Hwy 2 and I-90. This causes a bit of uncertainty about exactly how much snow the Passes could receive overnight. </p>
<p>A second round of showers should impact the west slopes of the Cascades Monday morning as the trough finally pushes inland. The round of snow doesn't seem to last too long, and, overall, the trend on Monday will be drying. High pressure starts to build in behind the exiting storm. Expect some sun breaks and maybe even clearing, particularly east of the Crest. </p>
