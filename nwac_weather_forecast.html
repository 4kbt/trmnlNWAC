<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We are in store for a chilly week! An upper-level low remains parked off the coast of Western Washington, spinning sporadic and isolated snow showers into the mountains. Light low-level east flow and Fraser outflow will keep temperatures cool as mid-elevation high temperatures max out in the teens with light to moderate east winds at ridge tops, Mount Hood excepted. Skies will stay generally cloudy, with perhaps a few breaks here and there. Snow accumulations will be hit or miss, though generally distributed across both the east and west slopes of the mountains. Even the most favored locations arenâ€™t likely to eek out more than an inch or three of low-density fluff. Showery activity decreases and further isolates overnight into Tuesday as the trough continues to dive to the south and west, bringing most, but all showery activity with it. Temperatures remain low on Tuesday with a further decrease in showery activity and maybe even some clearing skies in the mountains.</p>
