<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Warm temperatures and high freezing levels from this afternoon won't cool much overnight as a slow-moving frontal system approaches the coast. The Pacific frontal system will stumble inland to the Olympic Peninsula before daybreak Sunday, but with upper-level ridging amplifying over the intermountain West, the front will have a difficult time making headway further inland on Sunday. </p>
<p>There is still a range of outcomes regarding the eastern extent of the precipitation on Sunday, with the best consensus pointing to partly sunny/filtered sun for the west slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood in the morning, giving way to overcast skies and light precipitation in the afternoon, with precipitation rates approaching moderate for the west slope volcanoes in the afternoon. Light precipitation may not make it east of the Cascade crest by 5pm Sunday and eastern spots will likely see more sun during the day. There's better confidence S-SE winds will increase on Sunday, becoming strong for the Hurricane Ridge and Mt Baker area later in the day. Once precipitation does begin, snow levels will be well above Pass level and higher trailheads. </p>
<p>The front will slowly slide inland Sunday night, spreading precipitation further east. SSW flow aloft will likely favor the volcanoes for the heaviest precipitation amounts.  Snow levels will slowly fall to 5000-5500' by Monday morning as cooler air seeps into the region. On Monday, look for unsettled showery weather as an upper level feature rotating around the base of a broad trough of low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska brings about renewed showers in the afternoon. </p>
