<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in a rinse and repeat pattern over the short term with upper level ridging offshore battling with the storm track and jet stream pointed into northern British Columbia. For tonight through Tuesday night, we'll see periods of high clouds slipping under the ridge. Forecast models have not been particularly useful with fine-tuning the timing of the higher clouds, so a broad brush of partly to mostly cloudy has been applied to all zones except into Oregon where clearer conditions are more likely. Sunny skies are more likely on Wednesday as the upper level ridge shifts inland along the West Coast. </p>
<p>We'll see a slow warming trend over the short term as well. Despite the high freezing levels, mountain temperatures will once again hew close to the freezing mark on Tuesday, with temperatures mainly in the 30s and low 40s, and then warm a few more degrees on Wednesday with the aforementioned sunnier skies.  Near Stevens Pass and along the east slopes of the Cascades, low level inversions will keep chilly temperatures below 5500' or so, especially during the night-time.  </p>
<p>Finally, moderate NW ridgeline winds with even stronger winds in the alpine will continue through Tuesday night before finally backing off on Wednesday.   </p>
