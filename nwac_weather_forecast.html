<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's cold out there once again with mountain temperatures in the single digits and even a few areas below zero for areas near the Cascade crest and along the east slopes of the Cascades. We're in for another cold and sunny day today but areas further west of the Cascade crest will see some temperature moderation with daytime highs warming into the 20s vs the teens further to the east.  </p>
<p>We'll see a ridge of high pressure sliding over the area today and crossing the Cascades tonight. A weather system will undercut this ridge on Thursday, as it approaches our coast.  E-SE ridgeline winds have increased a bit earlier than expected for the West South zone and Snoqualmie Pass.  The main wind event is still to come - look for increasing E-SE winds in most zones starting this afternoon, but peaking overnight through Thursday late morning.  Combine this with the frigid temperatures and many areas will see dangerously low wind chills over the next 24 hours - layer up appropriately if you're headed out. </p>
<p>An occluded front will rotate up from the south on Thursday, bringing light snow to Mt Hood and eventually the southern and central Cascades during the day.  This system should produce a few inches of snow but won't be a big weathermaker. </p>
