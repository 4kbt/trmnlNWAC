<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a quiet afternoon weather wise with mostly cloudy conditions along the west slopes of the Cascades and partly sunny skies along the east slopes. We'll see high clouds from a weak weather system move inland late tonight and generally thicken during the day on Wednesday. A weak weather system should lead to some drippy conditions over the northwest Cascades and the Olympics. For areas further south and east, look for sunbreaks, filtered at times by the passing high clouds. Similar conditions will persist overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning. </p>
<p>An active weather pattern will kick off Thursday.  A stationary strong ridge of high pressure positioned offshore and will keep the jet stream from sinking too far south over our area, aka keeping conditoins milder than we would like to truly kick off winter in the PNW. The first shot of warm frontal moisture on Thursday will lead to periods of light to moderate precipitation, especially along the west slopes of the Cascades and major Passes.  Snow levels will begin rise during the day on Thursday, quickly over the Olympics and Mt Hood area and more slowly over the WA Cascades.  This pattern will feel familar over the next week.  </p>
