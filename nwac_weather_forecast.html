<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A stronger storm system replaced the last one, spreading a broad precipitation shield into the Pacific Northwest as of Tuesday afternoon. It is arriving a few hours ahead of schedule. Widespread moderate to locally heavy precipitation will douse the west slopes of our mountains, peaking in the evening hours as snow levels rise to 3000-4000 ft overnight as a warm sector of the storm moves through the region. Light to moderate precipitation moves into the east slopes of the Cascades during this period.</p>
<p>Moderate precipitation continues for the west slopes of the Cascades. The cold front stalls over the southern portion of the forecast region, maintaining steadier precipitation in these areas, while showers continue further north with cooling temperatures. Expect heavy convergence snowfall on Friday, extending from the Mt Baker area and dropping southward toward the mountain loop. A shortwave embedded in the stalled front may bring a pulse of moderate to heavy precipitation in the afternoon, potentially extending north and east as far as Washington Pass. The Cascades generally can expect 6-18" of snow above the rain/snow line through Friday.</p>
<p>The convergence snowfall continues over the central Washington Cascades as light to moderate rain and snow showers gradually decrease, and snow levels drop to 2000-3000 ft Friday night. Saturday stays cold with some residual very light snow showers for the west slopes of the Cascades with partly sunny skies further east.</p>
