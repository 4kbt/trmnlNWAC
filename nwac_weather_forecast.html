<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">After a relatively quiet day in the high country, bands of light snow showers are being pushed into the mountains on the coattails of increasing westerly winds. Accumulations will be generally light in most locations, but a modest Puget Sound Convergence Zone should lead to a bit more snow locally between Snoqualmie and Stevens Pass in the early evening hours. Near Mt Hood and the southern Volcanoes, more significant snow accumulation is expected overnight and early on Tuesday behind the departing surface low to the south. Most mountain locations dry out overnight as a quick ridge builds over Washington, and Mt Hood starts to clear out by Tuesday afternoon. There may be a passing snow shower here and there on Tuesday, but these should be light and short-lived. Expect low clouds in the morning, which linger for much of the day on the West Slopes, thinning and allowing for filtered sunshine in the afternoon at the lower elevations. Meanwhile, mid and upper-elevation slopes on both sides of the crest, and all elevations on the east side should see significant sunshine, seasonal temperatures, and moderate winds on Tuesday, making for a lovely day in the mountains.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The dry weather won’t last long as the next system arrives on Wednesday. Timing isn’t completely certain yet, but light precipitation should begin sometime in the afternoon hours with the heaviest snow arriving after dark and overnight Wednesday into Thursday. This system should bring snow to mountain trailheads and above, though Snoqualmie Pass may wind up on the edge of the rain/snow line, as it has for most of this season.</p>
