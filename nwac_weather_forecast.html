<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A few showers continue to dribble snow flurries, mainly in the Mountain Loop and Mt Baker areas. Elsewhere, skies are quickly becoming mostly clear with a few lingering low clouds. It should be a quiet and beautiful start to the day. Expect mostly sunny skies and generally light winds as we enjoy a break between weather systems. </p>
<p>The next storm won't wait its turn. High clouds start to increase around mid-day for the southern half of the region and in the afternoon for locations farther north. Ridgeline winds will turn more E-SE-S and increase significantly toward sunset. It looks like a very windy evening in the mountains. Expect the strongest and gustiest winds in the Olympics, along the southern Cascade Crest, through the mountain Passes, and near Mt Baker. While not quite as strong as some recent wind events, the gusty nature of these winds will get your attention. </p>
<p>A warm front lifts SSW to NNE in the late evening bringing rain and snow to the mountains. Precipitation should help quickly drag snow levels to 3000-4500 ft for most areas. Mt Hood may hang on to some warmer air for a bit longer. With a more southern bent to this storm and upslope SE winds, we expect decent precipitation along the eastern forecast zones. </p>
<p>Showers linger into the morning hours, but once again the trend will be for drying, clearing, and decreasing winds. Low clouds should linger the longest in the mountain gaps and along the west slopes of the Cascades. This break will once again be short-lived as our active Holiday weather pattern keeps on rolling. </p>
