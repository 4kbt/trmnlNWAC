<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We'll see a near repeat of Saturday as a cold upper low rotates snow showers inland today.  Showers will become more widespread and will feature some pulses of higher snowfall rates in the afternoon and early evening thanks to a cold unstable air mass, daytime heating, and a weak upper level disturbance.  Most areas should see a few inches of low density snow before sunset, with the Olympics, closer to the low, once again serving up a more moderate serving of new snow.  Snowfall amounts will taper quickly the further east of the Cascade crest.  </p>
<p>The upper low will slowly sink south tonight and Monday and colder air from the interior of British Columbia will start to seep out of the Fraser Valley and along the east slopes of the Cascades.  We may see a more focused area of snow showers for the western Cascades of Whatcom and Skagit Counties tonight as onshore flow combines with Fraser Outflow, but otherwise snow showers will become isolated overnight.  </p>
<p>On Monday, expect slightly chillier temperatures with widespread teens for daytime highs at mid-elevations and single digits or colder at upper elevations.  We'll see more pop-up daytime light showers in the afternoon, except slightly cloudier and steadier light snow along the east slopes of the Cascades with light upslope flow. </p>
