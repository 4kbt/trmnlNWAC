<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest sits under weak northerly flow aloft at the western edge of a broad trough over the western US. This weak troughing creates just enough instability for continued light showers on Wednesday. These showers will be more driven by low-level onshore flow. A weak convergence zone currently sits over the Hwy 2 corridor, but moisture barely reaches Stevens Pass. This feature is likely to either remain in the same general vicinity or shift slightly north into the Mountain Loop as the day progresses. In other areas, scattered to isolated rain and snow showers are rotating in from the NW. They could become slightly more convective and intense during the afternoon. Snow levels will be in the 3000-3500 ft range, with temperatures 5 degrees warmer east of the Cascades, where it should be generally dry.</p>
<p>Most shower activity tapers during the evening hours with partially clearing skies overnight as an offshore ridge begins to expand into our region.</p>
<p>The expanding ridge will increase sunshine on Thursday, with freezing levels rising to 4500-6000 ft by the afternoon.</p>
