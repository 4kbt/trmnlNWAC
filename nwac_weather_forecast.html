<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A few showers continue to linger along the west slopes of the Olympics and Cascades this afternoon, while areas near Mt Hood, Crystal Mt, and spots further east experience more blue sky. As we head into the evening the overall trend will be for drying and clearing as we start the clock on a roughly 24 hr break without precipitation. </p>
<p>Mostly clear skies and generally light winds overnight will allow low clouds and fog to develop in some of the mountain valleys and passes. In the morning, it could be socked in near the trailhead, but it's likely sunny above. This will be particularly true near the passes, where developing easterly flow could help keep the lower levels foggy much longer. The sunny skies won't last long. Clouds out ahead of our next storm should arrive in the Olympics and southern Cascades by mid-morning and then spread from SW to NE throughout the day. </p>
<p>Precipitation slowly drifts inland in the evening and overnight hours. With the jet stream keeping the bulk of the storm focussed well to our south, this doesn't look like a big snow producer for our region. Instead, generally light snow and moderate winds spread northward stalling out along the I-90 corridor by Wednesday morning. Showers continue to linger into the afternoon and evening along the west slopes of the range. While most trailheads will only see a few inches of snow, Mt Hood, Mt Rainier, and Mt St Helens could receive closer to 4-8 inches at mid-elevations. </p>
