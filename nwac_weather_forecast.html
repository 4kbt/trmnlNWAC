<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A low off the Oregon Coast continues to track NNE toward Vancouver Island Tuesday night. Rain and snow on Tuesday focused on the northern portions of the forecast region, but precipitation should fill in across the region during the evening hours and increase overnight. Most precipitation should be light, but SSW winds will focus moderate precipitation on the volcanoes along with more wind. Expect spillover onto the E slopes of the Cascades with light low-level E flow. Snow levels range from 3000 ft in the north, to 3500 ft around Snoqualmie Pass, and up to 5000 ft for Mt Hood.</p>
<p>The slow-moving front reaches the coastline Wednesday morning and pushes into the Cascades during the mid-day hours, allowing the SSW flow pattern to continue bringing in gradually warmer air. Snow levels rise to 3500-4000 ft in the central Washington Cascades as light to moderate rain and snow continue.</p>
<p>A deep upper trough begins to ease into the region Wednesday night, bringing rapidly cooling temperatures, decreased SSW winds, and a cold, showery, snowy regime ensues. On Thursday, expect a combination of locally intense snow showers with graupel, convergence precipitation in the central Washington Cascades, with increased convection in the afternoon with 1000-2000 ft snow levels and lower snow ratios.</p>
