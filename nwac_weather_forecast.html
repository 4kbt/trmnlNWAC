<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Post-frontal showers are starting to become more scattered for areas south of I-90 while a Puget Sound Convergence Zone (PSCZ) is taking shape over Snohomish and Skagit Counties.  Heavier snow showers with strong/extreme winds will continue from the Canadian border to I-90, piling up additional snow through this evening, with the highest snow total where the PSCZ takes aim  The likely snow winners will include the Mt Loop Hwy, and Stevens Pass, with Snoqualmie Pass (at mid/high elevations) and Mt Baker in close seconds for storm totals.  Strong westerly ridgeline winds will continue to spill significant snow over the Cascade crest through this evening as well as snow levels hover between 3000-3500'. </p>
<p>Showers will taper off overnight and a ridge of high pressure will quickly build over the West Coast on Wednesday.  Freezing levels will soar to 8000-10000' across the region. However, colder air pooled along the eastern slopes of the Cascades and some low-level easterly flow will keep lower and mid-elevations near freezing for Stevens, East Central and East North in particular on Wednesday with milder temperatures at higher elevations.  There may be an uptick in S winds Wednesday afternoon as the upper level ridge begins to buckle. </p>
<p>A weak weather disturbance will largely stay to our north as it passes into B.C. Wednesday night and Thursday morning. We should see an increase in high clouds, particularly for northern zones, but freezing levels will quickly rebound Wednesday afternoon. The east slopes of the Cascades will be warmer on Thursday as temperature inversions and easterly flow weaken. </p>
