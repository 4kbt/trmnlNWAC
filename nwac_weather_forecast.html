<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Another day of dry mild weather is in store for us as an upper level ridge continues to dominate our weather pattern. Much like today, we'll see varying amounts of high clouds slip under the ridge tonight with temperatures sticking above freezing with the caveat of low level inversions. The depth of the low level colder air will be a bit deeper along the east slopes of the Cascades with inversions extending up to 5000' north of I-90. Moderate ridgeline winds (locally strong at upper elevations in the alpine) will also continue overnight for the WA Cascades and Olympics with generally lighter winds down near Mt Hood. </p>
<p>As the center of high pressure slides east and closer to our area on Wednesday, we'll see fewer high clouds and even warmer temperatures. Mid-mountain temperatures should be in the 40s with even a few 50s possible. Ridgeline winds will also ease compared to the last few days in this pattern.  </p>
<p>A moisture deprived frontal system will flatten the upper level ridge Wednesday night and approach the area on Thursday. The front should sweep through the NW to SE during the day.  We're likely to see a few inches of snow from roughly Snoqualmie Pass and northward over the west slopes of the Cascades. Further south and east the moisture dries up and we should little to no precipitation other than a trace of light snow or even freezing drizzle.This front will feature strong westerly ridgeline winds and snow levels and temperatures will fall throughout the day. </p>
