<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The cool post-frontal snow producing pattern gradually winds down Thursday night through Friday as a ridge expands into the region. The ridge has shifted flow aloft more northwesterly and initiated a warming trend that leads to a more stable atmosphere, and shallower, less vigorous snow showers. Most areas west of the Cascade Crest will pick up an additional 2-6" of snow through Friday morning, with 1-3" amounts expected in the immediate lee of the Cascade Crest. Snow levels will rise through as the precipitation tapers, but rainfall is not expected above 3000 ft. Drizzle could materialize up to 3500-4000 ft, but that is not the base-case scenario. Areas further south will warm more rapidly as the precipitation cuts off late Thursday night. Freezing levels will rise to over 6000 ft around Mt Hood by late Friday. The sky cover should feature filtered sunshine most of the day, with coverage expanding northward as the day progresses. Moderate gusty winds on Thursday will also gradually ease through Thursday night and should be mostly light by Friday.</p>
<p>Friday night and most of Saturday will be mostly dry, with the ridge pushing moisture north into Canada. Cloudier conditions will linger in the northern portions of the forecast region. A warm frontal rain band is expected to move into the Olympics by Saturday afternoon and could bring precipitation to the Mt. Baker area late in the day. This precipitation is likely to fall as snow above 3500-4000 ft, despite milder temperatures ahead of the front. Increasing moderate-to-strong S winds will make conditions unpleasant in parts of the Olympic and Mt. Baker areas.</p>
