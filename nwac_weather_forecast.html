<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a quiet weather day as a broad upper level trough pulls away from our area and an upper ridge of high pressure over British Columbia nudges closer to our area today.  Mostly sunny skies and breezy N-NW ridgeline winds will sum up the forecast for most areas today with freezing levels rising into the 5000-6000' range. There should be a few afternoon cumulus clouds that build up along the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes in the afternoon, along with some lower clouds near northeast WA Cascades. </p>
<p>A mostly clear Thursday night will give way to a sunny start on Friday. The upper level ridge will move over the PNW on Friday but begin to flatten. A frontal boundary will shift closer to our area on Friday, slipping over Vancover Island and southern B.C. This should cause some filtered sunshine in the afternoon as high clouds drift over the area, perhaps thicker over the Olymipcs and northern Cascades.  Freezing levels should be slightly warmer on Friday, rising to 5500-6500' in the afternoon. Breezy NW ridgeline winds will continue through Friday. </p>
