<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A wide band of NNW-SSE oriented clouds and precipitation precedes an occluded frontal system moving into our area on Saturday. Precipitation spreads throughout the area during the morning hours.Â Low-level E flow develops and gradually increases as the front moves into the area, creating some light upslope precipitation for the E slopes of the Cascades as well. Light snow increases along with generally SSW winds through the afternoon except in the Mt Hood area where a warm front likely moves through mid-afternoon. Temperatures also gradually increase as the day progresses, allowing snow levels to rise to 1000-3000 ft, but the E slopes of the Cascades and passes remain in the icebox.</p>
<p>A dry sector may exist south of Mt Rainier in the early evening, but moderate precipitation fills in during the late evening hours and overnight as the primary front moves through the region. Moderate SSW ridgeline winds focus on the volcanoes and elevate snow levels west of the Cascade Crest to 2000-4000 ft while low-level E flow peaks in the light to moderate range.</p>
<p>Post-frontal moderate snow showers continue on SW flow on Sunday as an upper low moves toward the coast from the NW. These showers and moderate wind speeds will focus more on the southern half of the Cascades. Snow levels linger around 3000-4000 ft west of the Cascades, but decreasing E flow should keep the passes colder.</p>
<p>Storm totals are likely to be in the 6-24" range for mountain areas through the weekend.</p>
