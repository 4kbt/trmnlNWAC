<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for another sunny day across the forecast regions as a high pressure ridge remains firmly in control of our weather. Temperature inversions this morning in many of the mountain valleys and passes should make it quite chilly at the trailheads. However, warmer air has already begun to push into the area causing temperatures higher up the mountain to climb. With plenty of sunshine, calm winds, and warming temperatures it may feel more like spring than mid-January. The exception could be some of the valleys east of the Cascade Crest, where cold air will do its best to persist throughout the day. While you could see passing bands of high clouds, particularly in the northern zones, it should be a beautiful day in the mountains. </p>
<p>Mostly clear skies allow temperature inversions to reestablish overnight even as the upper air mass continues to warm. Freezing levels and 5000 ft temperatures don't paint a very clear picture of the reality on the ground. You could encounter multiple freezing levels, with cold air pooling into valleys, passes, and other low lying areas. </p>
<p>On Thursday a short wave disturbance will approach from the north. Look for increasing clouds and ridgeline winds later in the day. Temperatures quickly fall as the system returns much colder air to the region. Precipitation should hold off until the evening for whatever is left of this weak storm. </p>
