<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Light rain and snow shower activity gradually decrease across the west slopes of the Cascades as NNW flow aloft continues with a high-pressure ridge building offshore. Very shallow convection focuses most of the snow showers that remain on the westernmost part of the central Washington Cascades and over the west slopes of the southern volcanoes. A shift to more WNW or NW winds has decreased the ridgeline winds for areas near and east of the Cascade Crest. However, Mt Hood (and potentially other volcanoes), may continue to experience gradually decreasing strong to extreme winds, particularly on the south sides of these features. Snow levels should hover around 3000 ft in most areas today.</p>
<p>A weak disturbance remains on track to pass over western Washington on NNW flow tonight. It should remain moisture-starved but could bring a trace to an inch of snow to parts of the west slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>Sunday will be slightly cooler than Saturday with more sunshine. However, as a ridge builds offshore, expect the start of a warming trend for the Olympics and Mt Hood. Ridgeline winds should be mostly light, but linger in the moderate range for Mt Hood.</p>
