<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A few stray showers and light flurries continue to fall in some parts of the Olympics and southern Cascades, but overall, the trend will be towards drier and colder conditions. A high pressure ridge in the eastern Pacific will slowly take control of our weather for the next several days. While there's a bit of nuance in each 12-hour forecast block, generally expect mostly clear skies with very cold nights and a slight bit of daytime warming. </p>
<p>Overnight, low clouds and fog will be common in the mountain valleys and passes. Higher up the hillsides, it should be mostly clear. This will allow for temperatures to cool dramatically, especially in the East North zone. Many locations will experience nighttime lows near 10 F. Brrr! </p>
<p>On Monday, a weak and dry short-wave disturbance moves south from British Columbia. It should help push the low clouds further and further south. While this system should be mostly dry, areas in the southern forecast zones and Mt Hood could see a few flurries late in the day. The most notable part of this subtle trough will be a slight uptick in easterly winds. Right now, this doesn't look like a major wind event, but it will be noticeable in the Passes and along the Cascade crest. Winds should peak in the late afternoon or early evening hours. </p>
<p>Clear skies and cold northerly flow aloft will once again let temperatures plummet Monday night. Sunshine on Tuesday will help the mountains warm slightly, but overall, it's going to be quite cold for the Pacific Northwest. Many mountain locations may struggle to reach the mid to upper teens in the afternoon. This same very cold, clear night and sunny but chilly day pattern hangs with us through at least the middle of the week. </p>
