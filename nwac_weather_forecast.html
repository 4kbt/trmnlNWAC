<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper level weather disturbance is lifting northeastward across the area this morning, bringing a burst of moderate rain and snow to most mountain locations over the next few hours along with moderate S-SW winds. Snow levels are generally between 4000-5000' along the west slopes, Olympics and Mt Hood, and 2000-3000' along the east slopes north of I-90.  The Passes will see mostly snow this morning, but there may be a few patchy areas of freezing rain east of main Passes. </p>
<p>We'll see a switch to SW flow this afternoon with scattered showers and snow levels around 3500' on the west side and 4500-5000' along the east slopes. The Mt Baker area will see the heaviest and longest duration for moderate precipitation today. </p>
<p>The last shortwave assocaited with an upper trough of low pressure offshore will swing by tonight, bringing generally a lighter round of showers and slowly falling snow levels. There may be a brief period of convergence near the Mtn Loop and Stevens Pass to add a few additinonal inches of snow late tonight into Monday morning.  Expect generally light and scattered showers along the west slopes of the Cascades on Monday with more sunshine east of the Cascade crest and down near Mt Hood. </p>
