<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A ridge of high pressure remains over the region, gradually shifting eastward through Wednesday. Above around 5000-6000 ft, most areas will experience warm, dry air as freezing levels climb to 10,000-12,500 ft by Tuesday afternoon. However, the highest freezing level doesn't tell the full story. A dense pool of cold air remains entrenched over the Columbia basin and with light ridgeline winds across the region, this cold air pool is likely to thin slightly, but not fully displace. As a result, expect temperatures to remain in the 10s and 20s for areas east of the Cascades and those exposed to low-level E winds. Warm air will continue to over-ride this cold air pool, so expect temperatures to warm significantly if you gain elevation on Tuesday. The Olympics and areas further west of the Cascade Crest won't experience this low-level cold air. Areas near the Crest of the Cascades, where these air masses collide, could see significant temperature shifts over very short distances and at elevations.</p>
<p>A subtle shift to SW winds will help bring a bit more warming to the region on Tuesday and Tuesday night. Tuesday night will maintain some higher cloud cover over Washington State, but expect enough radiational cooling to allow the cold pool to persist. </p>
<p>By Wednesday, the cold air pool loses some of its strength, but still expect to find lower-elevation temperatures in the upper 20s and low 30s in the typical cold pool locations, such as east-side valleys and mountain gaps. Above the inversion, freezing levels should be in the 9,500-11,500 ft range.</p>
