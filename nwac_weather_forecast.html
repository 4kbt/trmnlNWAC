<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>445pm Update: Increased West South winds tonight. </strong></p>
<p>A wet and active weather pattern starting this afternoon will continue through early next week. A slow moving frontal system in SSW flow will bring a round of moderate to locally heavy precipitation and generally stormy conditions this afternoon through tonight. The higher peaks and volcanoes along the west slopes of the Cascades will likely pick up an inch or more of water Sunday night. Even the Wentachees/Mission Ridge may be quite wet thanks to more southerly flow with this system. Unfortunately this system is starting warm and will be slow to cool, with snow levels starting around 7000' this evening and only descending to 5000-5500' late tonight. </p>
<p>We won't get much of a break on Monday as a deep upper trough in the NE Pacific sends another vigorous upper level shortwave across the area, first reaching the Olympics in the morning and then spreading into the Cascades in the afternoon. While this isn't an atmospheric river, look for some heavier precipitation rates and strong winds for the Cascades during the afternoon with snow levels 4500-5000'.  </p>
<p>Showers will continue Monday night, potentially continuing to hammer the Mtn Loop to Mt Baker area as snow levels fall to 3500'. Before we can catch our breath, a new low pressure system will curl towards the San Juans, with renewed precipitation and wind Tuesday afternoon. </p>
