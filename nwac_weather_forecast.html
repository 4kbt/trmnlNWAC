<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Saturday features a much-needed break in the wet weather as an unusually warm December high-pressure system begins to shift eastward. With plenty of moisture in the Puget Sound lowlands, some patchy low cloud lingers and might squeeze out some drizzle early in the day in the Mt Baker area. Mountain temperatures are generally in the 30s and 40s early Saturday. Temperatures should rise into the 40s and 50s at 5000 ft with mostly sunny skies and patchy low cloud, mostly in the Mt Baker area, early in the day. The exception is the Methow Valley, where temperatures hover just below freezing at all elevations early Saturday, and temperatures should rise into the upper 30s once low-level temperature inversions mix out late morning.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, high clouds spread into the region with a narrow band of briefly moderate rainfall moving into the region overnight. It should reach about as far SE as Snoqualmie Pass by 4 AM Sunday before mostly fizzling out during the morning hours. A convergence could develop over the northern Cascades or the Mountain Loop as the day progresses. Snow levels hover around 6000-7000 ft, with limited cooling behind the front as an atmospheric river approaches our offshore waters.</p>
