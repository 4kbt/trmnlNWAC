<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">This morning, a blip of a system brought a bit of drizzle, perhaps a dusting of snow, some increasing winds, and not much else. Many mountain locations saw a mix of sun and clouds with cool temperatures and decreasing wind speeds through the day. This evening, a cool trough will drop down from the north, bringing showers and decreasing snow levels through the day on Sunday. Moderate to occasionally strong ridgeline winds hone in on the East Central and East South, but winds elsewhere are generally light to moderate. Snow levels bump up just a bit during the day Sunday before cooling further Sunday night into Monday morning, bottoming out around 2500ft. Storm totals are generally light through the day, favoring the West Slopes and passes I-90 and north, especially the Mount Baker area, where 1 to 6” of snow may fall. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">As the trough passes by and heads east, the focus switches to a Puget Sound Convergence Zone that looks to take aim at the Snoqualmie Pass area in the evening and overnight hours into Monday. We still have to work out the details, but where the bullseye lands, a few inches down low and 6-10" at mid and upper elevations are possible. Parts of the West Central and Stevens Pass could benefit as well, depending on how things take shape.  </p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Precipitation begins to taper on Monday, with some snow showers lingering at the passes and West Central/West North. Even there, things should dry out by Monday evening. Temperatures remain cool with northwest flow aloft. Sun breaks should increase in the afternoon, especially east and south.    </p>
