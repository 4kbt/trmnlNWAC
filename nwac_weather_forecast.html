<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A historic and long-duration rainfall event continues across our region as an atmospheric river brings very warm, moist air to Washington State. Seemingly defying the laws of physics, Washington Pass continues to pick up snowfall, but it is likely to change to rain at some point on Wednesday and at the very latest, Wednesday evening. Most other areas are measuring rainfall in inches from Mt Rainier northward, but also Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. The combination of strong WSW winds and the moist air leads to very strong vertical motion and a very effective squeegee of the moist air as it arrives on a strong jetstream. The strong winds also continue to a lot of moisture over onto the east slopes of the ranges. This combination is leading to major river flooding and has already led to some historic river flows. The most intense rainfall is likely to shift north today and focus from Snoqualmie Pass to Mt Baker. It could ease slightly at Snoqualmie Pass in the afternoon, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The focus of the precipitation remains focused on the central and northern portions of Washington State in the evening, but shifts back slightly southward overnight with a cooling trend. Ridgelines around Mt Baker and Washington Pass should turn back to snow. The cooler, drying trend continues over northern Washington as moderate to heavy precipitation becomes light to moderate by the afternoon and may shut off in the northern part of the state. Most areas won't pick up more than an inch or two of snow with the cooling trend.</p>
