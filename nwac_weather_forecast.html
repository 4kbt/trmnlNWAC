<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A frontal system is passing through the Cascades early this afternoon with a burst of heavier precipitation, snow levels around 4000-4500' and gusty ridgeline winds. This period of moderate/heavy precipitation will be short lived; both the precipitation and winds will taper off this evening, except over the northwest Cascades where moderate showers will linger longest including the Mt Baker area, where another 1/2 inch of water (6" above the rain/snow line) is likely.</p>
<p>Upper level ridging will briefly shift over the area later tonight through Sunday morning, but don't get used to the idea of dry weather.  Another frontal system will spread precipitation into the Olympics in the morning, and into the WA Cascades/Mt Hood in the early afternoon with another increase in ridgeline winds. </p>
<p>There will be a warming trend for areas west of the Cascade crest, the Olympics and especially Mt Hood where rain should push above 6000' before sunset on Sunday. The Cascade Passes and east slopes of the Cascades will stay cooler, with Snoqualmie clutching onto 3000' snow levels thanks to persistent cool easterly flow early on in the storm.  Precipitation will become heavier in the late afternoon and evening as the front approaches.  A trailing upper level trough will pass through after midnight, helping push out the colder air along the east slopes and bringing about a more uniform 4000-4500' snow level across the area as the precipitation becomes showery after midnight.  </p>
<p>Light showers will linger into Monday morning as transitory ridge builds over the inland NW, allowing us to dry out in the afternoon.  </p>
