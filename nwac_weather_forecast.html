<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>If you're excited to play with new toys in some fresh snow, then you're in luck. A short wave weather system will push across the area today. Overall, look for the weather to become increasingly stormy with gusty winds and periods of heavy snow developing around midday. </p>
<p>The first bands of precipitation are already reaching the Olympics this morning. Showers will arrive along the west slopes of the Cascades before transitioning to steady snowfall closer to lunchtime. This isn't a particularly powerful storm. Precipitation will struggle to make it to far east of the Cascade crest. Generally, cooling temperatures throughout the day and overnight should maintain snow at all but the lowest trailhead elevations. The other story will be the winds. Strong and gusty winds near Mt Baker in the morning will shift further S and E as the bulk of the precipitation arrives. Expect winds to increase for locations like Mission Ridge, Mt Hood, and the West South zone.</p>
<p>The storm really crescendos in the evening hours with periods of heavy snow and strong and gusty winds. Precipitation turns more showery overnight with a Puget Sound Convergence Zone forming. This narrow band of more intense snowfall appears to set up between Hwy 2 and I-90, spilling over into the Salmon la Sac area. However, small shifts in this feature could bring significantly more or less snow based on its position. </p>
<p>By Saturday morning, a high pressure ridge starts to build off the coast. This will help the region to dry out and clear up. Showers should taper from North to South throughout the day, lingering longest near Mt Hood. Behind the precipitation, sun breaks should follow. You're most likely to see proper sunshine in areas near the Canadian border and east of the crest. This will mark the beginning of a reprieve from the wet and wild December weather we've experienced. </p>
