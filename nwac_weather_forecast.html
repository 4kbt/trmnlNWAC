<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Overall today was much sunnier than expected. Our storm system pulled further north into Canada and has been slow to begin its journey inland. It's finally on the move this afternoon bringing rain and snow to the Olympics, North Cascades, and Mt Loop Hwy areas. An associated cold front will cross the region overnight with a short but rather intense period of rain/snow and gusty winds. Precipitation will spread from NW to SE reaching the I-90 corridor in the evening and the Mt Hood and Mission Ridge areas a little before midnight. Generally moderate to strong and gusty winds accompanying the front will make it feel quite stormy. Cooling temperatures should bring a change from rain to snow at pass elevations with enough moisture left over to ring out several inches of snow at road level by Monday morning. </p>
<p>A Puget Sound Convergence Zone forms in the wake of the exiting front bringing locally heavier precipitation to areas between Hwy 2 and I-90. Elsewhere, low level moisture and onshore flow should form a few showers in areas near and west of the crest. Showers may continue into the morning hours, but overall a dry pocket of air will shift over the region. You could see partly to mostly sunny skies in many locations during the morning. Eventually, overcast skies should return sometime in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Generally zonal (W to E) flow aloft, will prevent the region from fully drying out. As a result, we can't rule out an isolated shower here or there Monday night into Tuesday morning. With a broad open trough developing offshore, the best chance for precipitation will be in the northern half of the forecast region. As the low pressure trough grows, our next storm system will push inland. Overall it looks like the bulk of the snow holds off until Tuesday night, but it could arrive a bit early bringing showers to the western zones before sunset. </p>
