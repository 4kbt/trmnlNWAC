<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After several stormy days, we're heading for a relative break in the action, but not before one last round of showers swing through the area today. </p>
<p>Lingering low level moisture, onshore (west) flow, and a relatively unstable atmosphere continue to maintain a few light showers along the west slopes of the Cascades and near Mt Hood this morning. A more concentrated band of precipitation has already started to push into the western Olympics. This wave of moisture will travel inland throughout the day increasing shower activity for most locations in the afternoon. The bulk of the snow rings out along the Cascade crest and Passes, and very little precipitation manages to make it further east. Low clouds keep the western forecast zones socked in throughout the day. However, areas further east should see much more sunshine. The sun could even peak through the clouds along the Cascade crest near Crystal, the Goat Rocks, and Mt Adams. </p>
<p>While a few isolated showers may continue to drip into the evening, the overall trend will be for drying and clearing. A transient high pressure ridge will provide us with about 24 hours of dry weather and generally light winds. As skies start to clear Monday night, expect low clouds and fog to develop in the mountain valleys and passes. </p>
<p>Most locations should begin Tuesday with mostly sunny skies. However, our reprieve doesn't last long. High clouds drift into the region in the afternoon ahead of yet another storm system. The unsettled weather pattern stays with us through the remainder of the week. </p>
