<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The atmospheric river that won't quit continues to bring heavy rain and the highest-elevation snow over the central Washington Cascades. The atmospheric stability conditions are such that the brisk winds bringing moisture over the Olympics mostly split the rain and form a wide zone of convergence in the lee of the range. This convergence targets the southern Mountain Loop to Mt Rainier with the very heavy swath precipitation extending significantly onto the east slopes of the Cascades. The southward shift of the precipitation has brought significant cooling to the northern half of Washington State, with snow levels dropping to 3500-5500 ft from Snoqualmie Pass northward. Areas on the southern side of the convergence won't experience much cooling (Mt Rainier southward). Precipitation decreases significantly after 10 AM in most areas, except in the southern Cascade Volcanoes (including Mt. Hood). </p>
<p>The remnants of the stalled front continue to bring clouds, warm air, and more modest amounts of moisture into the region Thursday night and Friday. Most areas will experience periods of light rain and higher elevation snow throughout this period, along with a warming trend. Areas north of Hwy 2 could pick up an inch or so of snow before precipitation changes back to rain, with Washington Pass staying all snow.</p>
