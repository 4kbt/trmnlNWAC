<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Well, I hope you enjoyed the break in the rain, because it's about to abruptly come to an end. The next wave from an atmospheric river will slam into the Pacific Northwest this evening. Rain and snow should arrive in the Olympics around sunset and reach the Cascades near dinner time. There's no way to sugar coat it, its going to be a very warm, wet, and windy few days. As the precipitation arrives, temperatures will warm. Snow levels should rise quickly, topping out around 7500-8500 ft. The lone holdout? Washington Pass. The East North zone will try to hold on to relatively colder air. However, even this last bastion of snow should give way to the warmth on Wednesday. Once it warms up, it's not likely to cool much over the forecast period. </p>
<p>This system looks wetter than it did yesterday. That's pretty impressive. We'll once again be measuring precipitation in inches all across the forecast area. While the west side zones will certainly see the most intense precipitation rates (sustained periods of 1/4 to 1/3 inches per hour), even areas east of the crest will see inches of precipitation from this storm. Along with the warming and moisture, winds will also increase. Expect gusty winds developing in the mountains. Commonly windy locations will see very strong to even extreme winds.</p>
<p>While there may be a few ebbs and flows with this storm, don't look for any significant changes in the pattern until the system finally lifts north and draws to a close on Thursday. By that time, we'll be sitting nearly 40 hours into this atmospheric river and wondering when, if ever, the rain will stop. </p>
