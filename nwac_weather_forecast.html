<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">An upper-level trough keeps unsettled, though not particularly impressive weather in the picture during the day on Monday. The western slopes and the Olympics stay mostly cloudy with occasional filtered sunshine, while the eastern slopes and locations near the crest see some more partly cloudy skies with a bit more sunshine, especially in the morning. Expect passing snow showers in many mountain locations, especially on the west side and Mt Hood. As westerly winds increase through the afternoon, cloud cover should build and showery activity will become more widespread. A convergence zone sets up in the early evening and looks to target the Snoqualmie Pass area, perhaps extending towards the West Central and Stevens Pass as well, bringing locally heavier snow accumulations to those zones, while Mt Hood gets an even more solid wallop of snow overnight. Snow levels remain below all mountain trailheads.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Other than Mt. Hood, the mountains look to dry out overnight and through the day on Tuesday as a transient dirty ridge builds over Washington. It should be a pleasant day in the mountains. There could still be a stray shower or two, but only Mt Hood and perhaps Mt St Helens should receive impactful precipitation totals overnight and during the day. Even those locations dry later in the day as everywhere sees a relative break in the action before a series of storms make landfall on Wednesday afternoon.  </p>
