<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold upper trough brings locally intense convective snow showers into the Pacific Northwest on a light W flow on Thursday afternoon. The convection and intensity of the showers should decrease during the early evening hours, as WSW winds focus lingering convergence snowfall on the northern Mountain Loop and Mt Baker areas during the evening hours. Some convergence could spill over to Washington Pass. All snowfall should taper overnight with only a few lingering snow flurries by early Friday. Partial clearing and decreasing W winds should also help temperatures cool down even further along the east slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>Most of Friday will bring a break in the active weather for the Pacific Northwest as a WNW-ENSE oriented trough pivots toward the Oregon coastline. Mostly cloudy skies linger along the west slopes of the Cascades early with some partial clearing in the mid-day hours before clouds lift northward in the afternoon. Light snow develops in the Mt Hood area around 2-3 PM as the low pressure lifts northward. Steady snowfall intensifies and spreads northward into the southern Washington Cascades during the evening hours and throughout the region overnight, becoming moderate to heavy further south. SE flow ahead of the trough will combine with light low-level E flow to enable plenty of spillover onto the E slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>The moderate to heavy precipitation lifts northward on Saturday as WSW flow focuses the precipitation along the west slopes of the Cascades. Snowfall amounts should be in the 1-2 ft range for the west slopes of the Cascades through Saturday above the 2000-2500 ft rain-snow line.</p>
