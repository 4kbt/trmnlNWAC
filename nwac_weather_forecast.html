<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>This upcoming week would seem exceptionally wet and stormy if it weren't for the extradorinarly wet weather our region experienced last week.  Another atmospheric river will make headway into the Olympics and northern Cascades tonight, and fill in over the area on Monday.  The heaviest precipitation will likely be focused on the central and north Cascades, although everyone will get in the action.</p>
<p>Snow levels will start high and stay high through Monday afternoon. The one execption will be the East North zone including Washington Pass, where it's likely snow levels will stick around 6000' until mild air blasts in on SW winds mid-day/afternoon.  1-2 inches of precipitation will fall near the Cascade crest and along the west slopes of the Cascades during the day.  There will be east flow through the Passes initially tonight, but it won't make a difference as far as snow levels are concerned without our usual cold air pool on the east side of the state. Strong W-SW winds will become extreme later tonight through Monday.  Extreme west winds will linger into Monday evening along the east slopes of the Cascades.   </p>
<p>As the first moisture wave passes through Monday night, we'll see a cooling trend with snow levels falling to 3500' in the north and 5500' in the south.  Snow will accumulate at mid elevations and there should be a few hours of convergence that enhances snowfall in Whatcom/Skagit county Cascades Monday night, but likely stays north of Stevens Pass. </p>
<p>The cool down will be short lived as another impulse slides through on Tuesday, and with it another rise in snow levels.  This doesn't look to be quite as warm as Monday, but we should see snow levels shoot back up well above the major Passes. </p>
