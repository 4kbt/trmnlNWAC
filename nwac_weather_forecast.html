<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a dry, clear weekend with breezy to locally strong E-NE ridgeline winds and a slow warming trend. The Pacific Northwest is between two large scale weather features this weekend, an upper ridge of high pressure offshore and a closed area of low pressure over California. This High over Low pattern, or Rex Block, will keep weather systems away from our area through the weekend and well into next week. </p>
<p>After a cold clear Friday night featuring mountain temperatures in the teens and even a few single digits, mid-mountain temperatures will largely rebound into the 20s under sunny skies Saturday. We'll see more in the way of warming on Sunday as milder air to the west makes its way over the Olympics and inroads along the western slopes of the Cascades. It's unclear how far east warm air will push in at upper elevations for the Passes, and along the Cascade crest on Sunday. Mt. Hood will likely be the coldest spot over the weekend closer to the southern upper low.  </p>
<p>E-NE winds will be another unusual piece with this weather pattern. Winds will start to increase tonight, touching moderate in many areas through Sunday morning.  However, closer to the California low, Mt Hood will see a long duration period of strong E-NE winds starting tonight through Sunday.  </p>
