<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The southern end of a cold front brings an abrupt end to the unseasonably warm weather of late. This front brings a 2-3 hour of band moderate rain/snow band with the back edge of the front cutting off steady precipitation around 9-10 AM. E flow should keep precipitation frozen at the passes and east of the Cascades with snow mixing with freezing rain at times near the Cascade Crest. Moderate ridgeline SW winds switch W or WNW behind the front as low-level winds shift W, equilibrating the air masses on both sides of the Cascades to a snow level of around 3000-3500 ft. Ridgeline winds increase and become moderate to strong for mountain gaps, the E slopes of the Cascades, and Mt Hood, which continue at least through Friday night. The main feature to watch as post-frontal rain/snow showers gradually decrease Friday afternoon will be bands of moderate to locally heavy convergence focused between the southern mountain loop and Mt Rainier. This activity continues through the evening hours and wanes overnight.</p>
<p>Snow levels bottom around 2000-2500 ft and only rise slightly during the day on Saturday. Expect WNW flow to keep clouds and moisture banked against the west slopes of the Cascades with light snow showers continuing. Further east, expect partial cloud cover. Ridgeline winds only ease slightly on Saturday, continuing to focus on similar areas.</p>
