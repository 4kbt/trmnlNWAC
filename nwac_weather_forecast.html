<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Brrr...we're in for a cold one today. Mountain temperatures are in the single digits to below zero Fahrenheit this morning. The good news is that temperatures will warm into the teens this afternoon under sunny skies. Ridgeline winds are in the light to moderate range, so be prepared for a little extra chill on top of the already frigid temperatures. We're on the backside of a broad upper level trough with northerly flow aloft.  This is translating to slightly stronger ridgeline winds near the Canadian border where winds should spend more time in the moderate range. </p>
<p>We'll see some temperature moderation west of the crest tomorrow, with freezing levels bumping up into the 2000-3000' range Wednesday afternoon.  All other areas near and east of the Cascade crest will see similarly cold conditions on Wednesday.  E-SE winds may start to increase Wednesday afternoon as a weather system approaches from the west. </p>
