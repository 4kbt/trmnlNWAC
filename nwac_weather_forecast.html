<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Broad-scale troughing over the region combined with low-level onshore flow keeps clouds over western Washington and Oregon, along with snow shower activity. A shortwave trough embedded in northerly flow aloft increases the chances for weak convergence to form in the highway 90 to highway 2 vicinity Tuesday night and lift northward into the mountain loop on Wednesday. Most areas will receive less the 1" of snow during each 12 hour period, but isolated locations could pick up a quick 1-3" of accumulation. Snow levels bottom out around 2000-2500 ft Tuesday night and rise to 3500-4000 ft on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As the trough continues eastward Wednesday night throught Thursday, the shower activity will continue to decrease and is likely to end by Thursday. However, some low clouds are likley to remain banked against the west slopes of the Cascades. Freezing levels likely rise to 4000-5000 ft by Thursday afternoon as winds become universally light.</p>
