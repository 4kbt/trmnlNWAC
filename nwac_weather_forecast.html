<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A warm front continues to advance across WA as it drops lowland rain and mountain snow on both sides of the Cascades, the Olympics, and Mount Hood. Snow levels will rise a bit during the day before the trailing cold front brings them back down. Expect wet snow, maybe mixing with rain, at trailhead and pass elevations. The daytime portion of this event favors Mount Baker, the West South, and Mount Hood, with generally modest accumulations elsewhere. An important feature of the storm is upper-mid and upper-elevation winds. While the 5000' wind speeds are in the moderate range in most locations, wind speed is increasing rapidly with elevation, delivering strong and gusty winds to the upper slopes, as exemplified by the 50 mph sustained winds at the top of Crystal Mountain.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of uncertainty in how the post-frontal period takes shape this evening. Many model solutions have a healthy dose of post-frontal precipitation focused on the passes, Mountain Loop, West and East South, and Mount Hood. We'll have a deeper look at that in this evening's forecast. Regardless, precipitation tapers overnight into Thursday as a short-lived ridge tries to build over Washington. This ridge will have to duke it out with a warm front passing by to the north that may keep some showers near the coast and in the northern portion of the forecast area on Thursday.</p>
