<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's stormy across the mountains this afternoon as the last in an impressively long (3 weeks) stretch of active weather finally draws to a close. A short wave system will continue to bring snow and gusty winds to the area this evening. Unfortunately, only a few showers will make it over the Cascade crest. Steady snow will turn more showery overnight, with the exception of under a Puget Sound Convergence Zone. This narrow stream of locally heavier precipitation seems to aim between Hwy 2 and I-90, likely having the greatest impact on areas near Salmon la Sac and possibly the upper Icicle Canyon. However, small shifts in its location could drastically change where this extra shot of snow falls. </p>
<p>Many locations will start Saturday cloudy. There's even a chance for showers, especially near what's left of the convergence zone, in the southern Cascades, and near Mt Hood. However, a high pressure ridge building offshore will usher in a well deserved break in the precipitation. Look for sunshine and clearing first in the Olympics, near the Canadian border, and areas further east. Blue sky could slowly spread south in the Cascades by the afternoon. Don't be surprised if low clouds cling to the passes and valleys, even as it's clear above. Saturday will also bring us some of the coldest temperatures of the season. Areas in the Methow region could easily dip into the single digits. </p>
<p>Light winds, mostly clear skies, and cold temperatures should help low clouds and valley fog develop Saturday night. Without much wind to help mix them out, these clouds could persist for much of Sunday morning. After a frigid start to the day, temperatures will slowly climb. Freezing levels could get a bit messy as warmer air pushes in to the area at higher elevaitons capping the cold dense air near the surface. Significant temperature inversions and maybe even multiple freezing levels could be the norm. </p>
