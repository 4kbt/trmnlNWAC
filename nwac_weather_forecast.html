<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">An upper-level low off the Western Washington coastline continues to spin isolated and light snow showers into the Puget Sound Lowlands and the Olympic Peninsula. At the same time, Fraser outflow and low-level east flow are helping to keep things cool while creating somewhat favorable conditions for light upslope snow showers along the east slopes of the Cascades and northeast slopes of the Olympics. With all the lowland accumulation (Neah Bay reports 7”!), you might think it would be hammering snow in the mountains, but alas, it is not. While generally cloudy conditions persist, the weak onshore flow aloft isn’t doing much to steer these showers into the mountains and the moisture is being squeezed out at the lower elevations. We do expect some light showers to make their way into both sides of the crest this evening and overnight, but accumulations will be very spotty and hit or miss. Simply put, there is a lot of uncertainty and low predictability associated with this type of weather pattern. As of this afternoon, it seems the West South may win the sweepstakes overnight, but we are talking generally low totals (a few inches perhaps), and we wouldn’t be surprised if they got less and a different zone got a little bit more. Whatever does fall should be low density and fluffy!</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Moving forward into Tuesday, expect more of the same. The trough will start to dive south and west, and conditions will remain generally cold. Light to moderate winds are a bit variable depending on elevation as these multiple features fight it out for dominance in direction. The general trend will be for lower-level east flow, weak west flow at higher elevations, mid-elevation temperatures in the teens and 20’s, and spotty sporadic snow showers with light accumulations where there fall. Little change in the pattern through Wednesday, with more hit or miss snow showers and some breaks in the clouds. The big exception here is Mount Hood and parts of the West and East South, which could benefit from the very northern portion of a sizeable storm impacting California to the northeast through Montana. We will have to watch that play out tomorrow and hone in on Wednesday's precipitation totals for the southern zones.</span></span></p>
