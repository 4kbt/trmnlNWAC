<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal system will lift north over the area today, bringing glancing periods of light precipitation (mostly rain) to areas south of Hwy 2 and steadier, but still relatively light rain to the northwest Cascades and the Olympics, especially in the afternoon. Snow levels will be high, 8,000-10,000' as we inch towards the winter solstice.  Easterly flow is present, but there's not much cold air to nudge snow levels lower in the Cascade Passes. There's a slight chance of a wintry mix along the east slopes of the Cascades, anywhere pockets of low level sub-freezing air and light precipitation occur today.  Most areas can expect moderate southerly ridgeline winds, except strong for the Olympics and northwest Cascades. </p>
<p>Light rain showers will linger for the northwest Cascades and Olympics through the early evening hours.  Otherwise we'll see a mainly dry Friday night with elevated snow levels. SE winds will begin to ramp up late tonight, becoming strong before sunrise as another frontal system approaches. </p>
<p>We'll start off Saturday warm and windy with a slightly stronger frontal system pushing inland mid-day.  Expect a switch from breezy to strong, E or SE winds to W-SW in the afternoon with a frontal passage.  Snow levels will fall quickly with the onset of precipitation and settle around 4000' Saturday afternoon.  This won't be a big storm, most WE totals on Saturday will be around 0.25" or less. </p>
