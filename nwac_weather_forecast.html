<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Following a very active weather weekend, the Pacific Northwest dries out for the first half of the work week.</p>
<p>The previously unstable atmosphere stabilizes during the evening hours and NW flow shifts N as the upper trough slides eastward. The last convective showers could bring 1-2" of additional snow to the southern Cascade volcanoes, with flurries or sprinkles elsewhere. Partially to mostly clearing skies overnight will aid radiational cooling, leading to a chilly start on Monday. Most areas will be under sunny skies with light NW winds as a narrow but amplified ridge offshore gains full influence over the region. Sinking air under the high pressure starts warming Mt Hood in the afternoon, with freezing levels rising to 7000 ft, while in other areas freezing levels stay below 5000 ft.</p>
<p>Monday night will be clear and cool, particularly east of the Cascade Crest and through the mountain gaps as light E winds develop. Inversions form below 5000 ft and persist into Tuesday as the high-pressure centers over the region. This will keep lower elevations closer to seasonal norms as freezing levels rise to 9-11k ft. The air stays dry, so don't expect it to feel as warm as the freezing levels suggest above the inversion.</p>
