<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for another cold night with overnight lows in the mountains in the single digits and some below zero readings along the east slopes of the Cascades.  A slow-moving weather system off the Oregon coast will cut under an upper-level ridge tonight.  This will result in an increase in high cloud tonight but, more importantly, will crank up the E-SE winds over all areas due to the synoptic pattern (counter-clockwise around the low pressure) and increasing offshore gradients.  </p>
<p>Winds will be strongest over the central and southern WA Cascades and Mt Hood with E-SE winds peaking Thursday morning through mid-day. Combine the wind with the ongoing cold temperatures, and we have a combination for dangerous wind chill values, make sure to layer up appropriately. </p>
<p>The low-pressure system will spin up an occluded front during the day on Thursday, with light snow spreading from Mt Hood in the morning and its northward progress stalling around the Hwy2 corridor in the afternoon. This system should bring anywhere from an inch of snow to 2-5" for the southern WA Cascades and Mt Hood.  </p>
<p>Showers will continue Thursday night and taper down on Friday. E-SE winds will back off Thursday night and become westerly on Friday. With the switch to westerly (onshore) flow, temperatures and snow levels will bump up and moderate a bit on Friday. </p>
