<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#222222">A moderate storm continues to impact the forecast area. Precipitation totals have disappointed a bit and come in under our predictions. As the trailing cold front passes through, snow levels drop slightly overnight, however, we don’t expect much additional precipitation. Winds will turn west and what post-frontal showers do appear should be focused on the west slopes from I-90 north to Mount Baker. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#222222">Overnight and into Thursday, most mountain locations dry out, except for a few stray showers here and there, especially points west and north. A quick ridge of high pressure tries to build over WA, but, it is battling it out with the next system making landfall to our north. Winds generally ease on Thursday and mountain locations south and east may see some sun, while the west slopes look to hang on to cloud cover for much of the day.  </span></p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#222222">Thursday night stays mostly calm and dry, but the trailing cold front associated with the system to our north pushes clouds and showers back into the mountains on Friday. Precipitation totals again favor the northern zones, but should be quite modest. This is just the precursor to the atmospheric river that will make landfall on Saturday and be with us through the weekend, at least. </span></p>
