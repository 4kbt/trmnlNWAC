<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A persistent offshore upper-level high becomes a ridge on Tuesday before shifting toward the coast. This will bring us more sunny and clear weather.</p>
<p>Broad-scale subsidence keeps us in a highly stratified atmosphere with an inversion in place. This gives us primary freezing levels in the 10,000-11,000 ft range, with secondary freezing levels in the 4000-5000 ft range. If you're below this secondary freezing level, expect frigid temperatures near and east of the Cascade Crest. Mazama takes the cake once again for the coldest temperature at 0F. Temperatures within this cold pool are generally similar to this time Monday morning, but temperatures above 5000 ft are generally 3-10F warmer. Tuesday will be the warmest day of the week in most of these middle and upper-elevation locations, with highs in the upper 40s to mid-50s. Inversions should weaken in the afternoon hours, but don't expect colder valleys to warm much (or at all) above freezing. Low-level easterly flow also peaks Tuesday morning (light to moderate) and gradually decreases through Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that NNE winds on Mt Hood are moderate to strong early Tuesday. This is likely caused by an interaction with the inversion and these winds should decrease as the inversion mixes out.</p>
<p>On Wednesday light WNW ridgeline winds gradually round the top of the offshore ridge as it flattens, bringing in gradual cooling at upper levels, but low levels along the east slopes of the Cascades and through the mountain gaps should warm relative to Tuesday.</p>
