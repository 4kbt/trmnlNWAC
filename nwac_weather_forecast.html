<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A frontal system is lifting from the southwest to northeast this morning across Washington State.  Steady, heavier precipitation associated with the frontal boundary will shift into the northern Cascades later this morning and post-frontal showers in westerly flow will continue to pepper areas behind the front with moderate to occasionally heavy snowfall rates. Moderate showers will continue through this afternoon, but become a bit more scattered for the central and southern WA Cascades.  Strong WSW winds will continue through this afternoon as well. Snow levels will hover around 2500-3500' along the Olympics, Mt Hood and west slopes of the Cascades today and a touch warmer along the east slopes. </p>
<p>A new frontal wave will develop off the Oregon coast later today with a new round of precipitation spreading first into the Mt Hood area this evening, and then as the low passes over central WA tonight, spreading renewed precipitation into the south and central WA Cascades.  The Mt Hood area and the far southern WA Cascades including Mt St Helens look to be the hardest hit with this storm, with another 1" or more of snow-water equivalent forecast Saturday night. These areas will also see a warming trend, with snow levels rising to about 5000' and extreme SW winds.  There's still some uncertainty regarding how far north the heaviest precipitation will extend. Further north, lighter showers will continue overnight. </p>
<p>We should start to see the frontal boundary associated with the heavier precipitation shift south on Sunday and away from Mt Hood. An upper level trough will shift over the PNW on Sunday, keeping showers in the forecast but with much lighter accumulations than earlier in the weekend. We'll see snow levels creep up a bit, especially along the east slopes of the Cascades on Sunday, into the 4000-4500' range during the afternoon. </p>
