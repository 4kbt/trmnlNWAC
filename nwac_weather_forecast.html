<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Dry and mild weather will give way to increasing high clouds on Saturday and eventually to rain and upper elevation snow Sunday or Sunday evening. Mild temperatures will hold overnight Friday, except for slightly cooler temperatures in the East North zone. Periods of high clouds will sneak under an upper level ridge tonight as well.</p>
<p>The upper ridge of high pressure will shift inland on Saturday, as a Pacific frontal system nears the WA/OR coast. Periods of filtered sunshine through midday will likely transition to mostly cloudy skies in the afternoon as high and mid clouds thicken. Freezing levels will peak in the 8000-10,000' range on Saturday and 5000' temperatures will top out in the mid 40s to low 50s. </p>
<p>The frontal system will likely spread light rain over the Olympic Peninsula before sunrise on Sunday.  However, the same upper level ridge will rebuild over the intermountain West, slowing the front's inland progress on Sunday. Forecast models are not in good agreement with how quickly precipitation pushes into the Cascades on Sunday, and whether or not precipitation pushes east of the Cascade crest at all. For areas that do see precipitation, snow levels will start around 7500' with this system. Currently, the best bet is to plan for continued mild temperatures, cloudy skies, increasing S-SW ridgeline winds, and an increasing chance of precipitation during the day. </p>
