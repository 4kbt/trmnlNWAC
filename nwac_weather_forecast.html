<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for another dry day with a strong upper level ridge of high pressure steering the storm track well north of our area.  However, we will see some high and mid clouds slip under the ridge during the day, creating some filtered sunshine in the afternoon.  We have strong temperature inversions once again, with most stations above 5000' reporting temperatures above freezing and lower stations well below freezing. The top of Alpental is 37F this morning at 5400' and the base at 3100' is a chilly 21F.  Brisk east winds through the Passes will bring low clouds up to and near the Passes, especially for Snoqualmie.  If you're exploring higher elevations today, you'll encounter a stiff W-NW wind above 6000-7000' over the Washington Cascades.  Freezing levels will be in the 9000-10000' range, although it will take until the afternoon for the warm air to fully work east of the Cascade crest. </p>
<p>Freezing levels will start to slowly fall tonight into Wednesday as a weak Pacific frontal system falls apart offshore but still manages to send mid and high clouds our way. </p>
