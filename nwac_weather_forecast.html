<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>415pm Update:</strong> Increased precipitation forecast for West Central tonight</p>
<p>Cool, mostly cloudy, and showery weather, especially for the west slopes of the Cascades, Mt Hood, and the Olympics, will persist through Wednesday as an offshore upper low slowly weakens and pushes inland. Widespread shower activity this afternoon should fade overnight, but moderate westerly ridgeline winds will continue in most areas. The nature of the showers makes it difficult to pinpoint who will see a trace and who might see 2-3" of new snow. </p>
<p>Showers on Tuesday should be more concentrated near and along the west slopes of the Cascades from about I-90 and northward.  Further south, showers will be more scattered but there still be plenty of cloud cover. Moderate NW ridgeline winds will be the strongest near the central WA Cascades and south to Mt Hood. </p>
<p>We'll be on the backside of a broad upper level trough covering the western third of the country Tuesday night and Wendesday.  An upper level disturbance sliding south over the area should lead to a brief Puget Sound convergence zone late Tuesday night through Wednesday morning. More mundane showers driven by day-time heating should take over for by Wednesday afternoon. Afternoon high temperatures will be slightly warmer east of the Cascade crest on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
