<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's another warm and sunny Spring day with widespread mountain temperatures in the 40s and 50s this afternoon.  Those mild temperatures and high freezing levels will hold through Friday with only subtle changes to the weather pattern. Friday will likely be the warmest day this week for many mid-mountain locations, with highs in the widespread 50s and perhaps even a few low 60s popping in the afternoon. A digging upper level trough well offshore will start to rotate up a few high clouds tonight, and perhaps a bit more tomorrow.  While Friday should still feature plenty of sunshine, expect a few periods of filtered sun with high clouds passing from south to north over the area.  Locally breezy E-SE ridgeline winds (unusual not for the strength of the winds, but for the time of year) will continue overnight and through Friday morning.  As more typical spring-time onshore flow increases during the day on Friday, winds should become lighter and more variable. </p>
<p>Onshore flow will increase on Saturday, resulting in a slight dip in freezing levels (8000' along the west slopes and 9000' along the east slopes) and 5-10F in cooling vs Friday, most pronounced near and west of the Cascade crest, along with light to locally moderate westerly ridgeline winds later in the day. There should be plenty of sunshine Saturday, but we may see a few more clouds buildup in the afternoon. </p>
