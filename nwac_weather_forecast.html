<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest remains in the final 24-36 hours of a cold, snowy pattern. An upper-level trough shifts east of the region on Thursday as a ridge builds offshore, switching upper-level winds NWerly. Scattered showers continue to move into the region on brisk W ridgeline winds, which will accelerate in some areas near and east of the Cascade Crest. Snow showers are becoming less convective and less intense as the atmosphere gradually becomes more stable. Expect less spillover onto the E slopes of the Cascades as a result. Some convergence potential exists from Skagit County down to I-90, but the location and timing of any relative weak convergence enhancement remains uncertain. Snow levels remain low, in the 1000-2000 ft range.</p>
<p>Snow shower activity becomes mostly light Thursday night as snow levels rise to 1500-2500 ft.</p>
<p>The expanding ridge cuts off lingering light precipitation from south to north on Friday. Expect sunshine by Friday afternoon and increasing sunshine for Mt Hood as freezing levels rise to 6000 ft. Conditions will be cloudier and cooler, with light snow showers or snow flurries, mainly during the morning hours, for areas further north. Expect sun breaks in these areas during the afternoon as snow levels rise to around 3000 ft.</p>
