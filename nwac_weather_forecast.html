<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a warm start to the day, temperatures are cooling ever so slowly from west to east across the area as a weak frontal system pushes through.  The system is part of a splitting front, where most of the energry and moisture is headed into N California and Oregon.  The remanants of the northern branch will traverse the North Cascades tonight, bringing a period of moderate precipitation rates this evening and overnight.  The Washington Pass to Lake Chelan area could see upwards of 0.50" of water through Tuesday morning due to some upslope enhancement and a period of N-NE winds.  Snow levels should start higher on the east side of the Cascades this evening in the 5000-6000' range and then cool to around 3500' overnight.  Lighter amounts will be seen across the west slopes of the Cascades, except in the Mt Baker area where a period of moderate rain/mid-elevation snow will hang on through the evening hours. </p>
<p>A weak trough will move the area on Tuesday, leaving us with a chance of showers and plenty of mid and high level clouds.  Snow levels will bump between 3500-4500'.  Upper level ridging will bring a period of drier weather Tuesday night and Wednesday.  However, offshore flow will increase later Tuesday night through Wednesday, with breezy to gusty E-SE winds developing near the Cascade Passes to the western Cascade foothills. Freezing levels will begin to rise on Wednesday, with the warmest temps and highest freezing levels realized the further west you travel from the Cascade crest. </p>
