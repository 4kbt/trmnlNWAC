<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An offshore ridge will bring mostly dry and progressively warmer weather to our region on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Weak onshore flow has kept some low-level moisture trapped below around 5000 ft in areas west of the Cascades early Thursday. This has spawned a few isolated snow flurries for the foothills of the Cascades. With daytime warming mixing up this cloud layer and the expanding ridge, the low-level moisture should give way to partly cloudy skies and fully dry conditions as the day progresses. Freezing levels will top out in the 4500 ft range near and west of the Cascade Crest and around 5000 ft further east. Light ridgeline winds will generally be out of the N.</p>
<p>Expect clear skies Thursday night, with temperatures remaining relatively steady.</p>
<p>Friday should be sunny and warm. Freezing levels rise to 6500-7000 ft in the afternoon as light ridgeline winds shift from N to SE.</p>
