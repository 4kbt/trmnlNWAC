<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The ridge of high pressure dominating our weather pattern flattens as the ridge axis shifts eastward. Wednesday and Wednesday night remain dry throughout the region. Some high clouds skirt NW Washington and filter into the southern portions of the forecast region on Wednesday. High clouds increase more significantly Wednesday night as a digging trough offshore pushes a disturbance northward toward our region. Freezing levels remain elevated in the 9,500-12,000 ft range. The entrenched cold pool remains in place, but continues to thin. Many ridgelines will become more exposed to SW winds aloft and warming. The thinning of the cold pool will become more pronounced in the afternoon hours, with most ridges moderating above freezing, while valleys and lower-elevation gaps remain cold.</p>
<p>That disturbance starts to bring light precipitation into our region from the south on Thursday. Precipitation is likely to reach the Mt Hood region in the morning and the southern half of the Washington Cascades in the afternoon. Precipitation type remains tricky as pockets of cold air remain at lower elevations and in the mountain gaps, so expect a mix of snow, rain, and freezing rain with high snow levels ranging from 3000 ft up to ridgeline elevations, depending on how much cold, dry air remains in a given location as that moisture moves in.</p>
