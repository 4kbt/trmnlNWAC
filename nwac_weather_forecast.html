<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A strong winter storm will start to wind down this evening. So far, snowfall totals vary widely with the passes only receiving 4-6 inches, while Mt Hood, Crystal Mt, Mt Rainier, and some of the eastern mountains picked up close to a foot, and Mt Baker topped 18 inches. But, the storm isn't quite done. </p>
<p>Lingering low-level moisture and onshore (west) flow will maintain post frontal showers overnight and into the early morning hours. The heaviest precipitation will be near Mt Baker and Mt Hood, with slightly less snow expected in other locations along the west slopes of the Cascades. A few showers could venture further east, but they should be few and far between. The strong and gusty wind that characterized this storm should also start to ease overnight and allow for at least some clearing east of the Cascade crest. </p>
<p>In general, Sunday should start cloudy across all except the most easter portions of the forecast region. However, the trend will be for drying and some clearing. Sun breaks are expected in all locations, but the greatest clearing should occur further south and east in the range. This pause in the action will be short-lived. </p>
<p>Our next approaching storm quickly shoves the dry high pressure ridge out of the region. High thin clouds out ahead of the storm should arrive in the Olympics and southern Cascades late Sunday afternoon. Precipitation moves inland overnight reaching the Olympics and areas south of I-90 around midnight. Snow continues to spread from S to N with plenty of moisture wrapping around the east side of the mountains. Weather models continue to struggle with the exact timing of this storm. That could greatly affect how much snow falls and when. </p>
