<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Low and mid-level clouds have become more widespread throughout the mountains as snow shower activity has begun to ramp up for the Olympics, Mount Hood, the western slopes of the Cascades, and mountain passes. With cold temperatures in place, expect a few inches of cold and fluffy snow tonight, with larger amounts possible locally, especially near Mount Baker and Rainier. Outside of the northwest Cascades including Mt Baker, snow showers taper overnight as east flow and Fraser outflow filter in, dropping the temperatures even further.</p>
<p>Monday will be the coldest day yet with mid-elevation highs topping out in the teens and generally light to moderate easterly winds at 5000â€™. Periods of light snow showers are possible in the afternoon, as well as some steady light snow developing along the east slopes due to light upsloping winds, but the general trend will be towards a decrease in snowfall totals. This cold and drying trend continues on Tuesday as Fraser outflow persists and the trough shifts further southwest, pulling most shower activity south of the forecast area, though localized snow showers remain possible. We may even see a shot of sun along the western slopes of the Cascades.</p>
