<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A well-defined secondary low has formed in the PNW offshore waters, along a frontal boundary linked to a deep Gulf of Alaska low. An approaching warm front lacks the strength of the subsequent cold front. This warm front will increase light rain and snow from around Mt Rainier northward. Precipitation could reach moderate intensity in the Mt Baker area during the afternoon, enhanced by increasing moderate to locally strong S winds. Meanwhile, low-level light to moderate E flow creates some upslope snowfall and cooler temperatures along the east slopes of the Cascades. Warming and drying down-slope for most of the west slopes of the Cascades will delay the onset of precipitation in some areas. Expect snow levels in the 2000-3000 ft range.</p>
<p>The cold front moves through late Wednesday evening. S winds, along with light to moderate rain and snow (heavy at Mt Baker), peak before winds switch WSW and become more impactful for the mountain gaps, Mt Hood, and E slopes of the Cascades. Post-frontal light to moderate snow showers focus on areas near and west of the Cascade Crest through Thursday as snow levels lower from around 3000-3500 ft Wednesday evening to 2500 ft Thursday afternoon.</p>
