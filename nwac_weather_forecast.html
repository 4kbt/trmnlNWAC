<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>235 PM Update</strong> - Added Extended Synopsis</p>
<p>We're smack dab in the middle of an active storm cycle.  After an atmospheric river pushed east of the area this morning, a series of fast moving Pacific frontal systems will impact the area through Tuesday. The first frontal system is lifting heavy precipitation from the south to the north this afternoon. This system will deliver a burst of heavier precipitation (high elevation snow, low/mid-elevation rain) and strong to extreme winds through late this evening, with precipitation tapering off in the south and lingering longest in the northern areas tonight. </p>
<p>We'll enjoy a short respite from the active weather later tonight and tomorrow morning in between frontal systems.  A deep low pressure system will begin to spread warm frontal precipitation up again from the south during the morning, with precipitation reaching the Canadian border by 4pm.  Winds will become strong for areas west of the Cascade crest, including the Mt Hood area, as the storm approaches Monday. A secondary impulse will bring another round of significant precipitation and strong to extreme wind Monday night into Tuesday morning. Post-frontal showers will pepper the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes on Tuesday, and strong winds will slowly decrease. Snow levels will be slightly cooler with the Monday night/Tuesday precipitation, sticking around 3500-4500'. </p>
