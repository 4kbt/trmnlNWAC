<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today may start with clouds, showers, and wind, but overall, the PNW is trending towards drier and more spring-like weather. A weak trough moved inland this morning, bringing a concentrated round of showers mainly to the west slopes of the Cascades from Mt Rainier northward. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone set up much further south than expected and is providing slightly heavier precipitation to the I-90 corridor. However, it's already showing signs of weakening. While you could see a few flurries near Mt Hood or east of the Crest, most showers should stay confined to the western forecast zones. By this afternoon, a high pressure ridge starts to build over the region, quickly putting an end to what's left of the showers. Mostly sunny skies should develop in the Olympics, eastern zones, and southern volcanoes. Elsewhere, significant sun breaks  seem likely, with the potential for blue sky to push even further northward. </p>
<p>A few stray showers may linger near Cyrstal or Mt Rainier this evening, but they won't amount to much. Mostly clear skies and low level moisture could produce patchy low clouds and fog in the mountain valleys and passes. As the high pressure ridge continues to build, warm air starts to work its way inland at upper elevations. This will be most noticeable on the higher volcanoes in the West, South and Mt Hood zones. </p>
<p>Sunday starts cool, and possibly foggy, but sunny skies and a warming air mass should result in a stunning day! Expect 5000 ft temperatures to rise into the low 40s, along with generally light easterly winds. The high pressure ridge and it's spring-like weather appear to stay with us for the remainder of the week. </p>
