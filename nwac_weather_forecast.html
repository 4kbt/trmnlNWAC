<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest remains in a very moist and strong SW flow as an atmospheric river bears down on the region through Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The most significant frontal wave of the atmospheric river reaches NW Washington and moves through the Cascades during the evening hours, spreading very heavy rain and higher-elevation snow throughout the region. The frontal wave is associated with a surface low tracking toward Heida Gwaii. The heaviest of the precipitation is likely to shift towards the central and southern Cascades as the night progresses with the strongest SSW and SW ridgeline winds are likely to be during the evening hours in the 20-30 mph range as snow levels peak in the 6000-9000 ft range.</p>
<p>Very heavy precipitation continues between frontal waves Sunday morning for the southern half of the Cascades with snow levels in the 5500-8500 ft range. Light to moderate precipitation can be expected further north and in the Olympics. In these areas, snow levels lower to 4500-5500 ft in the morning, rising to 5500-7000 ft in the afternoon. The final wave shifts SW flow more SSW in the afternoon and lifts heavy moisture back into the central and possibly northern Cascades.</p>
<p>Moderate to heavy rain and snow continue Sunday evening and become light to moderate overnight as the final wave of moisture lifts NE of the area. Snow levels gradually lower throughout the night.</p>
