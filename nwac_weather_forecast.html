<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An amplifying offshore ridge continues to bring dry northerly flow aloft and warming, sinking air over our region. Thursday night will be clear with light mostly N ridgeline winds. Temperatures will remain above freezing in most areas, dropping into the 30s and low 40s. Friday will be quite warm as the ridge axis shifts over our region by the afternoon. Freezing levels rise within the 9000-11000 ft range throughout the region on Friday. Temperatures remain very mild Friday evening, but drop sharply overnight as a weak front arrives on NW flow. The front passes early Saturday morning with most rain and snow shower activity finishing up by 11 AM, although clouds are likely to linger into the afternoon. Precipitation should be universally light. Some areas could receive a trace to 1" of snow as snow levels drop to 4000 ft for the west slopes of the Washington Cascades. Precipitation may or may not get as far south as Mt Hood. Expect partial clearing in the afternoon as snow/freezing levels rise around 500-1000 ft.</p>
<p>Moderate ridgeline winds will impact areas near and east of the Cascade Crest from Friday night through Saturday, likely peaking with the frontal passage early Saturday. Thanks to moderately strong pressure gradients across the Cascades, winds are likely to be felt down into the major highway corridors on Saturday.</p>
