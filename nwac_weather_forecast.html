<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Post-frontal rain and snow showers gradually decrease as the day progresses on Sunday. Temperatures are milder behind the front, so moderate W ridgeline winds will bring 4500 ft snow levels into areas near and east of the Cascade Crest as the day progresses, overwhelming the stubborn E flow. This milder air is unlikely to be accompanied by precipitation for areas more than 5 miles east of the Crest. The bulk of the light postfrontal shower activity should occur southward from the mountain loop with locally moderate intensity. All shower activity eases during the afternoon.</p>
<p>A low moving ESE into Oregon Sunday night will bring a period of light rain and snow. Models indicate that the northward extent will be around the Washington/Oregon border. We'll monitor for the potential of moderate precipitation around Mt Hood, but the system comes in with generally light ESE winds and minimal dynamic support. Most of the light precipitation should exit the area by Monday afternoon. Sunshine should increase across Washington from N to S on Monday. Light E flow brings a cool start to areas east of the Cascade Crest. Areas further west should experience more impacts of the offshore high pressure as freezing levels rise to Cascade Crest level in the afternoon.</p>
