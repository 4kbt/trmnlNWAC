<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p> A long-duration significant winter storm unleashes across the Pacific Northwest through the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>The front progressed into the southern Cascades Thursday night, but a moist flow continues on a brisk WSW flow. The northern half of the forecast region can expect moderate rain and snow showers that will be locally heavy in convergence in the vicinity of Snohomish County. Further south, the stalled front will bring more widespread precipitation that could become heavy in the afternoon with a shortwave feature. Expect convection, particularly in the late afternoon and evening hours. Winds will be mi the moderate range for areas exposed to WSW winds.</p>
<p>Winds increase overnight near and east of the Cascade Crest with shower activity and snow levels dropping below 3000 ft. A convergence drops southward toward Stevens Pass and could deposit significant snowfall.</p>
<p> Expect a relative break on Saturday as winds die down and snow showers taper early in the day. Saturday afternoon temperatures will moderate but isolated snow showers will cool things down when precipitation arrives.</p>
