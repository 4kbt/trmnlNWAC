<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A January drought has been a relatively common occurrence for our region in recent years. The current iteration takes that pattern into hyperdrive, with an unusually powerful ridge of high pressure parked off our coastline through the weekend into the first half of next week. </p>
<p>With 10,000 to 12,500 ft freezing levels and light winds aloft through the weekend, the drivers of local weather are focused on subtle shifts in cold air pooled east of the Cascades. Easterly pressure gradients peaked Friday night and remain stronger than originally forecast into early Saturday. This has driven the shallow pool of cold air to slosh up against the east slopes of the Cascades, thickening it over the mountain slopes (and thinning it farther east, such as at Mission Ridge). The result is that the cold air pool is slightly stronger and slightly deeper than this time Friday morning. A secondary freezing level can generally be found below 4500 ft (5500-6000 ft at Washington Pass). The layer of cold air will be accompanied by a shallow layer of low clouds that get ushered into Snoqualmie, but not the higher passes, during the overnight and morning hours.</p>
<p>As easterly winds gradually ease Saturday through Sunday, expect the cold air pool thin and warm air to expand further into the middle elevations east of the Cascade Crest. Plan for a range of temperatures over short distances. Cold air should generally remain limited to lower elevations near and east of the Cascade Crest and passes. Once you ascend in elevation, expect warm, dry, cloud-free conditions.</p>
