<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A vertically stacked low moves onshore over southern Oregon today. The influence of this low has brought colder air into the region along with N flow aloft. A weak shortwave ridge moving in on Tuesday creates some subtleties to the weather pattern today, capping moisture mostly below 9000 ft and limiting it primarily to the west slopes of the Cascades. A band of more continuous showers over northern and central Washington will gradually drift southward as convection helps diversify precipitation around the region in the afternoon. NW winds will also pick up for Mt Hood and the southern Cascade Volcanoes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A shortwave trough moves into the region Tuesday night into Wednesday. This will keep light snow showers focused on the western sides of our ranges. A converge band likely forms near Snoqualmie Pass Tuesday night and likely shifts northward toward the mountain loop on Wednesday. Models diverge regarding how well this band stays together.</p>
<p>Snow levels will be in the 3000-3500 ft range during the day and drop overnight to 2000-3000 ft. Expect freezing levels to be in the 4000 ft range during the day when showers are not overhead.</p>
