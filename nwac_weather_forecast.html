<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An impressive stretch of wet and wild weather will finally draw to a close, but not before one last hurrah. A weak weather system continues to lift northward this afternoon, along with light rain/snow and slightly warmer temperatures. E-SE winds have helped produce upslope showers along the eastside of the Cascades. This feature stalls out in the evening near the Canadian border when it runs into a larger approaching storm. Winds will shift to the SW, cutting off the upslope showers in the eastern zones, and focusing any remaining precipitation in the North Cascades. A few locations could experience partial clearing overnight, creating the chance for low clouds to form in some protected locations. </p>
<p>By Friday morning, our next storm is knocking on the door. Clouds thicken and lower quickly as a few light showers arrive along the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics. The bulk of the precipitation shows up around lunchtime with more steady snowfall. Fortunately, this storm also brings cold air, helping snowlevels to fall below most trailhead elevations. This short-wave system isn't particularly potent, so precipitation will struggle to make it very far east of the Cascade crest. In the northern half region, stronger and gustier SSW-SW winds should decrease and turn more westerly in the afternoon. Conversely, further south and east, winds increase with the shift in direction. Precipitation continues Friday evening, before it slowly tapers overnight. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone could bring locally heavier snow to areas between Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass. Right now, it's hard to pin down exactly where this firehose will take aim, but it could result in a healthy shot of snow by Saturday morning. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge starts to build off the coast on Saturday, helping us dry out and clear up. Showers should taper from north to south in the morning, with sun breaks and even proper blue sky following the same pattern in the afternoon. With northerly winds ushering in chilier air, expect some of the significantly colder temperatures than we've seen recently. </p>
