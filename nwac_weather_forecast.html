<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Late november is climatologically the wettest time of the year. This year, an offshore ridge maintains mostly fair weather through the weekend. Friday afternoon brings mostly clear skies and light winds to our mountains. Low clouds have formed below 3500 ft across the east slopes of the Cascades and lower mountain gaps and should stick around thanks to light to moderate low-level E flow. Expect chilly temperatures for mountain locations in these areas with milder temperatures thanks to downslope winds further west. On Saturday, a mid-level cloud deck may filter or obscure sunshine at times, but visibility should remain favorable across most terrain until clouds thicken late with a chance of very light rain or snow for some areas late in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Saturday night, a weak disturbance sliding into eastern Washington from interior British Columbia brings cooling, but carries minimal moisture. However, a brief pulse of westerly winds may be enough to produce a light dusting of snow at mid and upper elevations, with up to 1–2” possible over the southern Cascade volcanoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">The system clears out by Sunday, allowing for increased sunshine under dry, light NNW flow. After a chilly start, most areas should see freezing levels rebound to 4000-5000 ft in the afternoon.</span></p>
