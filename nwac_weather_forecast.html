<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A blocking ridge of high pressure brings unusually warm and dry weather to our region through Saturday.</p>
<p>A shortwave continuing to fizzle over the top of the ridge will continue to bring partly to mostly cloudy skies to the Olympics and northern Cascades through the evening hours. Expect clearing in most areas overnight as the ridge fully rebounds with only some low clouds lingering in the Puget Sound region.</p>
<p>On Friday, mostly sunny skies will dominate, with the ridge axis squarely over our region. Light winds and 7000-10500 ft freezing levels should make for another spring-like day in the mountains.</p>
<p>The ridge shifts slightly east Friday night, but continues to hold off incoming storms through Saturday. Expect temperatures to drop a few degrees with high clouds approaching in the afternoon ahead of the next system.</p>
