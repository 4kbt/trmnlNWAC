<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Warm frontal precipitation, the final component of our atmospheric river period, will increase across the area today, with heavier precipitation in the afternoon.  There's still quite the spread in the precipitation forecast for today, but the central and north Cascades will bare the brunt of the storm.  Several inches of snow accumulated overnight at mid-elevations in most areas, but unfortunately, snow levels will rise again today, turning snow back to rain at popular trailheads and ski-area bases. </p>
<p>A very strong cold front will smash through our region Tuesday night, creating stormy conditions with heavy precipitation and strong to extreme winds.  The front should pass through the Cascades in the 1-3am time frame, with snow levels dropping quickly to 2500'.  Before the frontal passage, the majority of the precipitation Tuesday night will fall as rain, at least at low and mid-elevations.  Winds will be ripping through this period. </p>
<p>We'll finally see snowflakes return to lower elevations early Wednesday morning and continue during the day.  Snowfall will accumulate along the west slopes of the Cascades and moderate to strong W winds will continue as well.  An area of convergence should help boost snowfall totals in the Stevens/Mt Loop general vicinity.  6-12" of snow along the west slopes and Passes seems like a good bet, with slightly lower totals elsewhere. </p>
