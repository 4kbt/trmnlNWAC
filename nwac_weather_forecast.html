<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A high-pressure ridge offshore has expanded and shifted eastward, drawing much warmer air into the region this morning. This setup is creating very tricky temperature profiles in the mountains. Freezing levels won’t tell the full story, and conditions may vary substantially from one valley to the next. Despite the overall dry pattern, a few flurries can’t be ruled out near Mt. Baker or in areas favored by upslope flow in the eastern forecast zones.</p>
<p>Temperatures start the day quite cold in all areas near and east of the Cascade Crest. With strong overnight inversions in place, expect temperatures to warm as you ascend. Warm air continues to push north and east throughout the day, steadily raising higher-elevation temperatures. Some of the cold air near and west of the Cascades may mix out this afternoon, but below-freezing temperatures should remain entrenched in eastside valleys and passes below around 5000 ft. You'll encounter a mix of filtered sunshine and obscured skies, with an increased likelihood of obscured skies as you head north.</p>
<p>Monday night into Tuesday will look very similar to the past 24 hours, except temperatures continue to climb as the ridge expands further. Flurries and cloud cover should also retreat further north. By Tuesday, above-freezing temperatures rise well above our forecast elevations, reaching roughly 9,000–11,000 ft. Cold is likely to hold fast below 4000-5000 ft east of the Cascade Crest and through mountain gaps. Temperatures are likely to peak on Tuesday afternoon in many areas.</p>
