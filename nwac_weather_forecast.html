<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Another day, another atmospheric river, or at least that's how it feels at the start of this winter season.  Heavy rain and high elevation snow will continue today, heaviest through mid-day, and become relatively lighter in the afternoon.  Snow levels are high 9000', except in the East North/Washington Pass area where they are likely around 6500-7000', but will rise to 7500' later today.  Besides precipitation, the winds will be the story with strong to extreme SW then WSW winds in all zones.  Those strong winds will continue longest along the east slopes of the Cascades tonight, especially in the afternoon and evening, battering areas with downslope winds that have already have saturated soils and several rounds of strong gusty downslope winds.  </p>
<p>Precipitation will taper down tonight along with a cooling trend.  An area of convergence will bring some fresh snowfall above 4000-4500' to all areas, with a likely bullseye of 6-10" for the Cascades of Skagit and Whatcom counties where a convergence zone sets up this evening.  </p>
<p>We'll see another pulse of moisture in our atmospheric river train on Tuesday that will target the west slopes of the Cascades from Snoqualmie Pass and norhtward with 1-1.5 inches of water.  Snow levels will rise, so we'll see a transition back to rain for most trailheads and ski area bases, with cooler snow levels closer to the Canadian border. Winds won't be quite as extreme on Tuesday but will remain strong out of the west. </p>
