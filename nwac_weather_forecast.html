<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal boundary is bringing a surprise round of rain this morning to the Olympics and the Cascades near and especially west of the crest. However, the main precipitation is still slotted to arrive this afternoon, with a focus on the Olympics, and the west slopes of the Cascades,with more moderate precipitation likely for the west slope volcanoes before 5pm. This will be mostly a rain event, with snow levels only falling to 7500' during the day. South winds will increase today as well, becoming strong over the Olympics and Mt Baker area. The east slopes of the Cascades will likely see some sun breaks this morning before clouds fill in. </p>
<p>A trailing shortwave trough will kick the frontal boundary inland tonight and spread precipitation over the east slopes of the Cascades. Look for a heavier shot of precipitation once again for the volcanoes with up to an inch of water (!) overnight.  Snow levels will slowly fall to 5000-5500' by morning. The Wentachees could pick up a decent shot of precipitation in this more southerly flow pattern. </p>
<p>On Monday, we'll see a new upper level feature reinvigorating showers in the afternoon, particularly over the Olympics, southern WA Cascades and Mt Hood. Snow levels will hover around 5000', except slightly warmer along the east slopes of the Cascades.  </p>
