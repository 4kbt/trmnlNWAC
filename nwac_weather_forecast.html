<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An occluded front will continue lifting north of the border this evening, leaving showers and strong westerly winds in its wake. The heaviest showers will focus on the northwest Cascades including the Mt Baker area where an additional 4-6" should stack up overnight. Showers will be more scattered and lighter elsewhere. Both shower activity and winds will trend downward tonight as the frontal system exists and a broad upper level trough settles in off the West Coast.  Low clouds will be more plentiful along the west slopes of the Cascades and on the west side of Mt. Hood tonight, with some clearing along the east slopes of the Cascades after midnight. It will be the coolest night in a while, with freezing levels falling to 1500-2500'. </p>
<p>The upper-level trough will rotate up some mid-level clouds on Wednesday, making for a partly sunny to mostly cloudy afternoon. General instability associated with the upper trough will maintain a chance of showers in the mountains as well. Freezing levels will only top out in the 4000-5000' range. Clearer and cooler conditions are expected on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>On Thursday, we'll be between two large-scale weather features: the trough will extend into the southwestern US, and an upper-level ridge will build upstream over central British Columbia. With northerly flow aloft, we'll see freezing levels capped at 4500-5500' and a few cumulus clouds build up in the afternoon, especially west and near the Cascade crest. Ridgeline winds will be light to moderate out of the north.  </p>
