<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold upper level low will slowly drift south from its current position over Vancouver Island to our offshore waters over the next few days. And while it does, it will continue to rotate a steady stream of snow showers over the region characterized by scattered showers in the overnight and morning hours, and then increase both in coverage and in intensity in the afternoon and early evening in this cold, unstable air mass with WSW flow aloft. Blustery ridgeline winds out of the West will continue to ease overnight into the light to moderate range on Sunday, staying elevated the longest in the Mt Hood area. </p>
<p>The good news is we have a steady supply of cold powdery snow arriving every 12 hours through Sunday night. The Olympics and northwest Cascades, including the Mt Baker and Mt Loop corridor, may be the winner snow-wise in this pattern, but all areas will see at least a few inches of snow. The caveat in this pattern is for areas further east of the Cascade crest where new snow amounts will tail off rapidly, including for areas near and further east of Icicle Creek/Tumwater Canyon. </p>
<p>The snow shower pattern is less clear for Monday.  Strong high pressure sliding down the Canadian Rockies will start to drive modified arctic air into eastern WA and down through the Fraser River Valley while the same upper level low sits over our offshore waters. A broad brush light snow shower forecast has been applied, but some areas over the Olympics or west slopes of the Cascades could see more moderate snowfall depending on how this plays out. Light upslope snow showers and cloudier conditions along the east slopes of the Cascades seem like a good bet. </p>
<p>Be prepared for cold temperatures.  Mid-mountain temperatures will struggle to reach 20F during the day, and you'll encounter lower teens and even single digits as you climb to higher elevations. Even colder weather will settle in early next week.  </p>
