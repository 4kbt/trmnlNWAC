<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Quiet weather will reign today with a few leftover showers, mainly around the Olympics, and otherwise dry conditions.  High clouds from a storm complex to our south will spin up over the area. The north Cascades and Olympics will likely see sunbreaks at the edge of the continuous high/mid cloud cover. </p>
<p>Light snow will develop along east slopes of the Cascades to near the Cascade crest as a weak warm front lifts north.  An upslope component will help squeeze out a few inches, particularly along the eastern slopes of the Cascades. The bigger story will be the increasing winds overnight, easterly at Pass level and E-SE at ridgeline.  </p>
<p>There's still considerable uncertainty about the track of the low on Wednesday.  This forecast reflects one with a surface low quickly tracking north along the WA/OR coast Tuesday night and Wednesday. This would bring slightly heavier precipitation to the Olympics and north Cascades as the front stalls out, and milder air pumping in for all areas. Most of the precipitation should fall as snow initially, but may transition to light rain/drizzle across mid-elevations Wednesday. The most significant weather impact will be the potential for strong to extreme winds.  As the low lifts north, it should bring strong to extreme S-SE winds into the area, especially near and west of the Cascade crest down to Mt Hood.  If the low tracks across the Cascades, the wind forecast will be much less impactful, and the warming trend will be less of a factor.  Stay tuned...</p>
