<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The new year starts with a pattern shift. A weak low-pressure center tracking off the Oregon Coast brings an end our recent ridge of high pressure. Light rain and higher elevation snow have started early Thursday in the Mt Hood region as a band of mostly light precipitation moves northward on southerly flow aloft. Precipitation type becomes tricky as this moisture moves into deeper cold air pools along the east slopes of the Washington Cascades and passes. We expect precipitation to commence as light snow in these areas, but as rain and higher-elevation snow further west. Precipitation should reach the central Washington Cascades during the afternoon.</p>
<p>The low-pressure center approaches western Washington on Friday night, spreading increasing light to moderate precipitation throughout the Cascades in the evening, intensifying further overnight. Moderate WSW winds should begin to erode the cold air pool in areas closer to the Cascade Crest, resulting in a change from snow to rain and freezing rain at Snoqualmie Pass during the evening hours, with that transition likely occurring overnight at Stevens Pass. Mission Ridge and Washington Pass are likely to stay snow.</p>
<p>Moderate rain and snow continue to focus on the west slopes of the Cascades Friday morning, becoming light in the afternoon as the low-pressure center exits the area. This precipitation falls as snow above 5500-6500 ft, except in portions of the eastern North Cascades, where the cold pool lingers.</p>
