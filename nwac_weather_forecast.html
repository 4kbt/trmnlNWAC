<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We have a mixed bag of freezing levels and cloud cover across the region this afternoon. Near and west of the Cascade crest, we generally have partly to mostly cloudy skies with high clouds and temperatures well above freezing.  Near the Passes and along the east slopes of the Cascades, we have low clouds anchored into valleys and the eastern approaches to the major Passes, and above freezing temperatures punching through to mid and upper elevations in an uneven fashion across the area.  </p>
<p>Conditions will begin to change as a weak frontal system flattens an upper level ridge tonight and opens the door to stronger W-NW winds for all areas along with a chance of light precipitation for the central and northern WA Cascades.  For areas that do see precipitation tonight there's a chance for a light wintery mix, with rain, snow and a freezing drizzle through Wednesday morning. W-NW ridgeline winds will largely be in the moderate range but will increase to strong in the alpine. </p>
<p>This system's impact will be brief as upper level ridging quickly rebuilds offshore and we start to dry out on Wednesday. Freezing levels will rebound, with the highest freezing levels for the south WA Cascades and Mt Hood area. Breezy NW ridgeline winds will slowly ease during the day. </p>
<p>High pressure will stay in control through Thursday, however, cool offshore flow will return.  We'll see another battle between mild air on the west-side and colder air on the east-side with temperature inversions for the places in-between.   </p>
