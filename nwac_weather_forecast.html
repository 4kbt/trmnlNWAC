<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Happy Winter Solstice! A frontal system will spread precipitation inland as it pushes from its current position along the coastline and crosses the Cascades in the early afternoon hours on Saturday.  High snow levels well above ridgeline for most areas early this morning will quickly fall with the onset of precipitation and settle into the 4000-4500' range.  Strong S-SE ridgeline winds will become blustery WSW winds with frontal passage later this afternoon.  Low-level offshore flow and east winds may initially drag snow levels down to 3000' for the Cascade Passes including Snoqualmie Pass mid-day, but they should bump back up to 4000' or higher with the frontal passage. </p>
<p>This system will be a quick hitter, with showers becoming scattered in the evening (lingering longest in the Mt Baker area) and tapering off Saturday night.  A shortwave ridge will move overhead late tonight through tomorrow morning, providing us with a brief dry period.  </p>
<p>Another frontal system will folllow quickly on Sunday, with winds and precipitation ramping up first for the Olymipcs in the morning and then for Mt Hood and the WA Cascades in the afternoon.  The Olymipcs and Mt Hood area will see the biggest warm up as warm frontal precipitation moves into the area, and to a lesser extent along the west slopes of the Cascades.  The Cascade Passes and east slopes of the Cascades will stay on the cool side, at least through the daylight hours on Sunday.  </p>
