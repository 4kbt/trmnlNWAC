<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a dry day, we'll ring in 2025 with lowering clouds and light snow developing for the central and south WA Cascades, and Mt Hood overnight.  This won't be a big snow producer but Mt Hood and Mt St Helens may end up with a quick 3-5 inches before daybreak with lighter amounts further north. The southern volcanoes will also see the strongest winds, tonight through Wednesday morning. There will be a brief period of post-frontal showers on Wednesday morning mainly affecting the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes. There will be some sunbreaks Wednesday afternoon, especially closer to the Canadian border. High clouds from the next system will begin to spill over Oregon and southern Washington by the afternoon, making for another afternoon with filtered sunshine. </p>
<p>A warm front will begin to spread light precipitation back towards Mt Hood and perhaps the south Washington Cascades Wednesday night.  An occluded front will move through the area on Thursday, spreading light to locally moderate precipitation over the area. Details are hard to pin down for the Mt Hood area, but it looks like there could be a wintery mix near anytime from Wednesday night through Thursday night.  Low snow levels over the Washington Cascades on Thursday will keep snow in the forecast for most lower elevation trailheads. </p>
