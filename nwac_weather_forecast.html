<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A frontal system offshore will bring another round of snow and wind to our mountains later today and tonight. Snow showers will favor the Olympics initially today, and then the Mt Baker area later this afternoon as the front nears the PNW coastline. All areas will see a period of moderate precipitation later this evening through early Tuesday morning, with diminishing snow showers early Tuesday morning. Southerly winds will increase later this afternoon and become strong across much of the region.  Snow levels will generally be in the 2000-3000' range. Snow totals today through tonight look to be in the 4-8" range, with totals potentially doubling that for the Olympics and Mt Baker area. </p>
<p>A few snow showers will linger into Tuesday morning but we'll generally be inbetween weather systems with a quiet forecast in the works.  High clouds from a developing low pressure system well to our south will migrate into the area during the day.  We may start to see E-SE winds increase for Snoqualmie Pass and south to Mt Hood during the afternoon hours on Tuesday.  </p>
