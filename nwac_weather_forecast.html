<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The trough over the Pacific Northwest keeps the jetstream, storm track, and most of the associated moisture south of our region Thursday night and Friday. The air mass in place remains unusually cold at all levels of the atmosphere, but the upper-level air begins to moderate gradually. With mostly clear skies for northern and central Washington State Thursday night and light winds, expect strong radiational cooling and some inversions developing. Temperatures in deep valleys, particularly east of the Cascade Crest, will drop into the single digits, while ridgelines might be 10 degrees warmer. Meanwhile, Mt Hood and the E slopes of the Cascades south of I-90 will experience high and low clouds thanks to low-level E flow and the outer periphery of a system impacting the intermountain west. Some very light snowfall can be expected in the eastern portion of these ranges. By Friday afternoon, increasing W winds associated with a shortwave trough passing mid-morning will increase the chances for very light snowfall on the W slopes of the Cascades from Mt Rainier southward through the afternoon.</p>
<p>A slightly more impactful trough arrives on NW flow late Friday night, spreading light to occasionally moderate snow into the Olympics and southern Cascades. This light snowfall spreads throughout the W slopes of the Cascades during the day on Saturday. W winds will help continue the very subtle moderate trend as snow levels rise to 1500-2000 ft in the southern Cascades while remaining below 1000 ft further north. This looks like a 2-8" snow event for the west slopes and passes at this time.</p>
