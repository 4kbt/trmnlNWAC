<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>NWAC forecasters are attending an end-of-season staff meeting Wednesday April 16th.  We will not issue a 230pm Mountain Weather Forecast on April 16th, but will resume regular weather forecasting operations on Thursday April 17th.  Thank you for your support as we wind down our season.</strong></p>
<p>High pressure continues to dominate the Pacific Northwest weather pattern for the remainder of the work week. However, expect subtle cooling and increased ridgeline winds as a trough digs southward from interior Canada into the intermountain west. This will increase NW flow aloft Wednesday night, translating to light to moderate W or WNW ridgeline winds near and east of the Cascade Crest. These winds peak overnight into early Wednesday evening before easing as flow aloft shifts northerly Wednesday night. The cooling associated with this system should lower freezing levels from 8000-10000 ft Tuesday evening to 6000-9000 ft by Wednesday morning. Afternoon temperatures should warm at middle elevations but may cool slightly further at the highest elevations. There is an isolated chance of showers on the east slopes of the Cascades, with some minor cloud buildup in the afternoon.</p>
<p>High-pressure dominates through Thursdayas a high amplitude ridge offshore continues to expand, maintaining dry northerly flow aloft. Temperatures on Thursday should be similar to Wednesday but a notch cooler in southern portions of the forecast region, still more under the influence of the Intermountain trough. Winds should be light and variable by Thursday.</p>
