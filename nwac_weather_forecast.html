<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest has entered a quiet weather pattern through Saturday as a ridge of high pressure exerts increasing influence.</p>
<p>Daytime heating has fueled scattered clouds and perhaps an isolated shower. These clouds should dissipate in the early evening hours across the region, yielding mostly clear skies. Meanwhile, a ridge of high pressure expanding inland from the offshore waters will initiate a warming trend, particularly at middle and upper elevations. This will create some inversions overnight as light N winds allow colder air to settle into the valleys. In most cases, below-freezing temperatures are the exception rather than the rule. Light ridgeline winds shift from N to SE.</p>
<p>Temperatures warm significantly on Friday as inversions correct and freezing levels rise to around 7000 ft in the afternoon. Light low-level E flow begins to develop alongside the generally light SE ridgeline winds.</p>
<p>Expect another round of weak inversions Friday night, with even warmer temperatures on Saturday. Mid-level clouds are likely to begin to move into the region by Saturday, so expect a mix of sun and filtered sunshine as freezing levels rise to 9000-10000 ft.</p>
