<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest braces for a wild week of weather as waves of moisture continue to ride over a strong ridge of high pressure anchored offshore. Fluctuating snow levels throughout the weekend will shift the lower limit between base-building wet, heavy snow and significant rainfall. Higher elevations, however, will receive substantial amounts of new snow.</p>
<p>The initial phase of the moisture feed is gradually easing somewhat on Friday afternoon, but many areas will continue to receive moderate to heavy precipitation. Moderate to strong W and WSW ridgeline winds will continue across most of the region Friday night through Saturday as a subtle trough ushers in a somewhat cooler phase of the storm and snow levels lowering to 4000-5000 ft. Moderate to heavy rain and snow become more uniformly distributed across the Cascades. Nearly all weather models lock in on a strong convergence zone, near or slightly north of Stevens Pass, Friday evening, which could produce multiple hours of 0.2-0.4" per hour precipitation and drag snow levels down to the Pass more quickly.</p>
<p>Precipitation continues to ease Saturday night, becoming mostly light. Snow levels begin to rise on Sunday as a subtle warm frontal system approaches, and switches winds southwest. Expect significant snow totals above the 4000-5000 ft snow line through early Sunday before snow levels rise to 4,500-6500 ft by late in the day. Upper elevations can expect several feet of snow accumulation through the weekend in many locations near and west of the Cascade Crest.</p>
