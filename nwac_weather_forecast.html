<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A stable stretch of weather will dominate Friday through Saturday, with dry conditions and plenty of sunshine in the mountains. An atypically strong offshore ridge of high pressure will remain firmly in place, steering Pacific storms well to the north and keeping our region locked into this quiet pattern into early next week.</p>
<p>Freezing levels will stay unusually high for late winter, hovering between 11,000 and 13,000 feet. Temperatures at most NWAC stations dropped into the 30s and low 40s, but deeper valley locations in the Methow have dropped into the 10s with a strong inversion in place. These inversions exist throughout the eastern Cascades, but diminish in strength as you go southward. Daytime temperatures at mid elevations will climb into the mid to upper 40s near and east of the Cascade crest, while locations west of the crest—including the Olympics and Mt. Hood—will see highs reaching the 50s both days. Despite the warmth aloft, cold air trapped beneath temperature inversions will allow overnight and early-morning lows to dip to near or below freezing in valley bottoms and at Pass level. Washington Pass is expected to remain the coldest location during this period.</p>
<p>Offshore easterly flow will persist through the weekend, producing occasional gusty east winds in the Passes and along exposed ridgelines. This has pulled low cloud through the Snoqualmie Pass corridor early Friday. This low cloud may persist much of the day. Higher Passes should largely keep cloud cover confined to their eastern approaches. Any low clouds encountered at lower elevations should give way quickly to warmer, sunnier, and much drier conditions with elevation gain.</p>
