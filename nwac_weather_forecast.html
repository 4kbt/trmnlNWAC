<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>NNW flow aloft maintains dry, cold weather from Friday through Saturday.</p>
<p>Temperatures are in the upper teens to low 20s at 5000 ft locations throughout the Pacific Northwest mountains. Chilly temperatures have also filtered down to trailhead locations. Most lowland locations throughout the Puget Sound are in the 30s while low elevations locals east of the Cascades area are in the 20s.</p>
<p>Cold clear nights and light winds allowed for strong radiational cooling Thursday night and the same is expected Friday night. On both Friday and Saturday, temperatures should gradually moderate under sunny skies. Expect colder temperatures to the west of the Cascade Crest on Friday. Locations near and east of the Cascade Crest will be colder on Saturday as light low-level E flow developing Friday night starts to form a cold pool with sub-freezing temperatures potentially entrenched or only moderating briefly at lower elevations in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Bring some extra layers and plan to bundle up, particularly during the morning hours.</p>
