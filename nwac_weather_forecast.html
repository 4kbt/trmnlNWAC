<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A frontal system lifting north this afternoon is bringing a burst of moderate precipitation to many areas. Showers will follow behind this front this evening in southerly flow aloft, initially favoring the higher peaks like the volcanoes and shadowing the Cascade Passes with lighter precipitation.  A deep low pressure system offshore will rotate a secondary frontal feature inland after midnight, bringing heavy showers to the Olympics first and then the Cascades before sunrise.  Winds will really begin to crank up for areas west of the Cascade crest and for Mt Hood tonight. </p>
<p>Other areas will not be left out of the stormy, showery weather on Tuesday.  The low center will push east of the Cascade during the morning with moderate to heavy showers and extreme W-SW winds for the central/south WA Cascades and Mt Hood. Showers will become more scattered in the afternoon, but there's a good chance that a Puget Sound Convergence zone will take shape over the central WA Cascades between Snoqualmie Pass and the Mt Loop Highway. Those strong W winds will allow significant shower activity to slop over the Cascade crest, although the further east you go, the conditions will become drier.  Snow levels will bump around 3500-4000' over this period, likely resulting in 1-2' along the west slopes of the Cascades and near the Cascade crest.  </p>
<p>Showers should will wind down Tuesday night with high pressure building offshore.  Wednesday will be dry and mild. Cool low-level east flow will result in temperature inversions for Stevens Pass and along the east slopes of the Cascades, meaning lower slopes may stay near or below freezing relative to upper slopes. </p>
