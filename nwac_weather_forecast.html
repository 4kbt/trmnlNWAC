<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>One more day of wind and rain before we see a major pattern change. This persistent atmospheric river (AR) continues to bring rain and very high elevation snow to the Olympics and Central/North Cascades. Expect the heaviest precipitation in the Mountain Loop and Mt Baker areas. Due to the narrow nature of the storm, we continue to suffer from the same problem: small shifts in its position result in big changes in rainfall amounts. Today, Snoqualmie Pass appears to be right on the line between significant precipitation and nothing impressive. Further south and east, there could be a few sprinkles, but overall it looks like a dry day. </p>
<p>With rain well above most of our mountain tops, the other big story with this storm is the winds. Expect gusty conditions throughout the day with strong to even extreme winds. The increase in wind speeds will be most notable for areas near and east of the Cascade crest. </p>
<p>Late this afternoon or evening a high pressure ridge builds into the Pacific Northwest from the south, pushing precipitation northward and finally drawing this warm, wet storm to an end. On Tuesday morning, low clouds may linger in the mountains, with a few showers still dripping near the Canadian border, but the trend will be for clearing. High, generally thin clouds could result in more filtered sunshine and keep it from going full 'bluebird.' 5000ft temperatures may rise into the upper 40s or even brush 50 degrees. This will be the start of a prolonged warm and dry period. But at least we should get plenty of sunshine. </p>
