<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest continues transitioning into an increasingly mild weather regime as we head toward the weekend. A warm front brings some light precipitation from Snoqualmie Pass northward early Friday morning. The front stalls closer to the Canadian border, enabling increasing moisture and SSW winds to wring out gradually increasing rain and higher elevation snow for the Mt Baker area as the day progresses. Further south, expect gradually warming temperatures within the warm sector. The one exception will be low elevations E of the Cascades, where low-level E flow will develop progressively a shallow cold air pool, complicating precipitation type near and east of the Cascade Passes once moisture rolls in.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a cold front spreads increasing mostly light rain, snow, and areas of freezing rain into most of Washington State. This precipitation becomes moderate intensity with the frontal passage during the evening hours and then tapers to light post-frontal showers overnight into early Saturday.</p>
<p>The first wave of an atmospheric river brings increasing moderate SW winds along with the development of moderate to heavy rain and higher elevation snow for the Olympics and the northern Cascades in the afternoon. Snow levels rise to around 5500 to 7000 ft.</p>
