<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold, dry weather pattern remains in place through the weekend thanks to persistent NNW flow and a very cold air mass over the interior of N. America.</p>
<p>At 5,000 feet, areas west of the Cascade Crest will experience the coldest temperatures on Friday, with daytime highs only reaching the mid to upper 20s. Overnight, colder air will sink deeper into valleys on both sides of the Cascades. A weak push of Fraser outflow winds overnight and early Saturday brings colder air to the Puget Sound lowlands and some locally enhanced NE winds for the mountains northwest of Mt Baker. Light easterly flow also develops through the Cascade gaps, shifting the coldest air east of the Cascade Crest and through the passes. With strong traditional cooling, expect a cold start on Saturday morning. Temperatures will moderate in all areas thanks to widespread sunshine, but more significantly in the Olympics, Mt Hood, and southern Cascade volcanoes as the offshore ridge gains influence.</p>
<p>An upper-level disturbance brings some high clouds and a shift to more westerly ridgeline winds late Saturday through Sunday morning. It will also be accompanied by an increased push of cold Fraser outflow winds, filtering more cold air into the Puget Sound Lowlands. Expect another chilly start on Sunday, but if high clouds are extensive, they may limit radiational cooling somewhat. These clouds should pass, revealing full sunshine from mid-morning onward.</p>
