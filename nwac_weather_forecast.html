<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Overall, it's been a nice day in the mountains. Recent snow, cool temperatures, generally light winds, and even a little sunshine... High clouds moved into many locations this afternoon, with Hurricane Ridge and Mt Hood looking like the last sunny holdouts. Easterly flow also began pushing low clouds and fog into the Passes, decreasing visibility at lower elevations. This pattern will persist overnight. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge off the coast expands this evening and flops to the east, drawing in much warmer air. This will create some very tricky temperature profiles as you ascend the mountains. Freezing levels won't paint a clear picture of what you might experience, and differences valley to valley might be common. Mostly cloudy skies tonight could prevent significant cooling, but there may be enough clearing for some patch fog and low clouds to develop in the mountain valleys. Easterly flow should maintain low clouds near and east of the passes. Even though we're in a dry pattern, you could see a few flurries near Mt Baker or with upslope winds in the eastern forecast zones. </p>
<p>It will be downright chilly at the trailhead to start the day. With temperature inversions from overnight, expect warmer weather as you ascend. The warm air continues to push north and east on Monday, sending higher elevation temperatures on a steady march upward. Much of the coldest air near and west of the Cascades could mix out during the day, but expect below freezing temperatures to stay entrenched in the eastside valleys and passes. You may find some nice sunshine, but overall expect mostly thin clouds. </p>
<p>Monday night into Tuesday is a rinse and repeat of the previous 24 hours. Temperatures continue to climb as the ridge expands even further. Above freezing temperatures reach well above our forecast elevations on Tuesday, to 9000-11000 ft. Cold air may cling to the east side valleys and passes despite the significant warming above. Temperatures seem to peak Tuesday afternoon, but this warm, dry stretch is far from over. </p>
