<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for an active start to the week as a deep upper trough in the NE Pacific sends pulses of moisture and wind our way.  After a rainy Sunday night, snow levels have lowered over the last few hours, with snow levels in the 5000-6000' range this morning. We'll see showers this morning, and then an upper level shortwave trough will rotate widespread showers inland this morning for the Olympics, reaching the West South mid-day, and eventually all areas in the afternoon with an increase in showers. Snow levels will be roughly 4500-5000' with the heavier afternoon showers, with slightly higher freezing levels for the east slopes of the Cascades before clouds/showers move in. The afternoon impulse will also generally take SW winds up a notch into the strong category. </p>
<p>Showers will continue Sunday night, peppering the west slopes of the Cascades in particular as snow levels fall to 3500' overnight.  A developing low pressure system will curl up towards Neah Bay on the NW tip of the Olympic peninsula on Tuesday, sustaining moderate to strong winds and bringing renewed moderate showers to the Cascades in the afternoon. Snow levels will be in the 4000-4500' range on Tuesday. </p>
