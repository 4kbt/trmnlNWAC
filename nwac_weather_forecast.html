<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Before high pressure takes control of the weather pattern, a weak weather disturbance will slide down over the area today in northerly flow aloft. This should keep low clouds lingering along with a few light showers for the west slopes of the Cascades, the Passes and the Mt Hood area with sunnier conditions for the Olympics and east slopes of the Cascades. The aforementioned upper level disturbance will also cause a shift from NW to NE or E winds later this afternoon and evening before turning back to NW later tonight.  We can expect period of moderate ridgeline winds, approaching strong near the Canadian border near and east of the Cascade crest.  </p>
<p>The upper level ridge will begin to exert more influence over the area late Sunday night through Monday.  Look for freezing levels to rise and mid-mountain temperatures to warm. While the freezing level bump will be eye-catching, mid and upper mountain temperatures will not sky rocket, this will be a slow warming trend.  </p>
