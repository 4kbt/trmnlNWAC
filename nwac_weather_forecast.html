<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper low positioned offshore will lead to showers and a fair amount of cloud cover over the region today.  An upper level disturbance rotating up from northern Oregon today should help focus an area of showers in the south WA Cascades later this morning and then the central Cascades this afternoon. The air mass is marginally unstable, so we'll see scattered convective showers elsewhere in the afternoon and early evening. Look for an increase in afternoon/overnight westerly ridgeline winds as onshore flow increases. Snow levels will be around 3500-4000' today with freezing levels 4000-5000', warmest along the east slopes of the Cascades. </p>
<p>The upper low will transition to an open trough tonight as it shifts inland on Tuesday.  This will position the PNW on the backside of the trough, translating to cool and showery weather, especially near and west of the Cascade crest, with more sunshine further east of the crest. Showers and clouds will likely be concentrated in the central Cascades Tuesday.  </p>
