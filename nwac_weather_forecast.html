<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Multiple systems will move through the region, bringing heavy snow and snow showers and increased winds.</p>
<p>The first of these systems is approaching the PNW Coastline on Sunday afternoon, spreading a thick swath of moderate to locally heavy snow out ahead of it. This precipitation should spread throughout the Cascades by evening. The heaviest snow will focus on the Mt Baker area, thanks to moderate SSW winds. The trailing cold front moves through before midnight, bringing a shift to WSW winds and an accompanying strong convergence zone mainly targeting Mt Baker overnight as decreasing light snow showers continue elsewhere. Snow levels drop overnight from 2000-3000 ft down to below 2000 ft by Monday morning as most areas get a relative break.</p>
<p>However, moderate snow continues over Mt Baker and the Olympics as a better-organized frontal system approaches Monday afternoon. The setup is similar to Sunday, but the winds will be stronger, and more precipitation is expected to spill over the Olympics to Hurricane Ridge. The rest of the Cascades experience moderate to heavy snow showers late Monday through the evening hours, then snow showers overnight. The wind shift won't be as significant with this system, which will only shift SWerly.</p>
<p>The offshore rotating low drops southward on Tuesday, resulting in a decrease in scattered to isolated snow showers across our region.</p>
