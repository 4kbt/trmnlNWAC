<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The cold upper trough off our coastline will deliver its last hurrah over the next 24 hours. The trough continues to drift toward the Washington coastline while a well-defined comma cloud shows up in satellite imagery off the coast of NW Oregon. The combination of increased cold air aloft generating instability and the comma cloud drifting NNE along the coast today and tonight will bring a snowy pattern to the Pacific Northwest. While the water numbers aren't impressive, the cold air will squeeze out high snow-to-liquid ratios and, therefore, significant snowfall amounts. Snow bands brought 1-2" in the morning for parts of the Puget Sound lowlands and areas near or west of the Cascade Crest. Snow showers or bands of snowfall will increase from south to north throughout the day, becoming moderate to heavy for Mt Hood and the southern Cascade Volcanoes and light to moderate in the central Washington Cascades. Most snowfall further north should be generally light.</p>
<p>The heaviest snowfall for most areas is expected during the evening hours, with the comma cloud centered just west of the Olympic Peninsula. Ridgeline winds increase from the WSW at this time, helping the mountain enhancement. The upper low merges with troughing over British Columbia overnight as snowfall generally becomes light. Expect continued snow flurries under the trough for the west slopes of the Cascades on Thursday, while the southern Cascades volcanoes may continue some periods of very light snowfall as moisture from a system approaching California shunts northward. Expect partly cloudy skies to develop for most of the central and northern Cascades by the afternoon with light winds and 500-1000 ft snow/freezing levels.</p>
