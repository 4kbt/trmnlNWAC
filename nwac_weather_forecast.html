<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Warm, wet, and windy conditions continue Sunday night and through much of Monday for most of our forecast region. An atmospheric river (AR) maintains a narrow band of heavier precipitation pointed squarely at the Olympics and the Central/North Washington Cascades. The areas could see periods of moderate to heavy and high elevation snow. South of the main firehose, precipitation becomes a bit more uncertain. Locations from Mt Rainier to Stevens Pass will see precipitation, but exactly how much is hard to pin down. Subtle shifts in the AR axis would have a big impact on how much rain falls. South of Hwy 12, you probably won't see much, if any, precipitation at all. </p>
<p>Temperatures continue to warm with this system overnight and into Monday. Snow levels climb past the tops of all but the highest peaks. There's no way to sugarcoat it; this storm is warm, and it won't help the snowpack. Winds also remain very gusty for the next 24 hours. With the pattern pretty much stuck, don't expect significant change until sometime late Monday afternoon or evening. </p>
<p>Eventually, a high pressure ridge builds into the Pacific Northwest from the south and kicks the nasty rain north into Canada. The region will start to dry out, and skies will clear from south to north. The last lingering clouds and showers loiter in the Baker region on Tuesday morning. As the ridge continues to expand, warmer and warmer air floods into the region. Freezing levels continue to climb, and we'll start the clock on a prolonged period of warm, dry, and generally sunny weather. </p>
