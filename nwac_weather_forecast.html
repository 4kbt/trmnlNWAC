<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A small-scale circulation center heads into British Columbia early Thursday morning, ushering in a cold upper trough. Brisk W winds continue to cool the atmosphere and will be impactful near and east of the Cascade Crest. The cooling air will offset much of the diurnal warming signal and change most areas to primarily snowfall. Wrap-around steadier moderate rain and snow should become showery by mid-morning. Models indicate a potential partial break in the shower activity mid-day with an organized band of precipitation moving through late in the day through the evening hours. Shower activity tapers overnight. Friday morning is the break between systems. Models have a spread in the timing of the precipitation as a trough lifts NE into southern portions of the forecast region. Expect some light snowfall to start in the southern Cascades during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Snow levels should fluctuate around 2000 ft on Thursday, 1000-2000 ft Thursday night, and 500-2000 ft on Friday.</p>
