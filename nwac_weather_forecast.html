<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A storm system will push inland today with light warm frontal precipitation beginning this morning, increasing in the afternoon, and intensifying further Sunday night. Snow levels will creep up to mid-elevations west of the Cascade crest approaching 4500-5000' for the Mt Baker area by sunset, and 5000-5500' for the West South zone and the Olympics, and 6500-7000' for Mt Hood.  Colder air along the eastern slopes of the Cascades combined with cool easterly flow will keep snow levels around 3000-3500' once precipitation gets going today for the Cascade Passes and along the east slopes.  Look for strong S-SE ridgeline winds in many areas in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Temperatures/snow levels will hold at these levels until a cold front passes through after midnight. A switch to WSW winds Sunday night will mix out the colder air along the east slopes of the Cascades and bring about a period of 4000-4500' snow levels across the region (a bit cooler for East North) as steady precipitation turns to showers.</p>
<p>A ridge of high pressure will build over the inland NW on Monday with a brief but notable drying trend taking place. Freezing levels will pop back up for areas west of the Cascade crest to 5000-7000'. We're entering a progressive weather pattern with systems every 24 hours or so. The next system is on tap Monday night.  </p>
