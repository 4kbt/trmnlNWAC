<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in a very active pattern over the next week with storm systems arriving roughly every 24 hours and increasingly strong and wet storms past Christmas and into the 2nd half of next week.  But before we get to the big ones, we'll have tonight's and Monday night's systems to contend with.  Warm frontal precipitation has spread over the area today and precipitation rates will intensify through Sunday afternoon and overnight.  Snow levels are highly location dependent, with warmer air worming its way into the Olympics, Mt Hood and west slopes of the Cascades and cooler air through the Cascade Passes and along the eastern slopes of the Cascades. Strong S-SE ridgeline winds will continue in many areas through this evening. Cool easterly flow will continue to drag snow levels down to Snoqualmie Pass level this afternoon through evening, but a rain/snow mix at 3000' will likely take hold sometime late evening even with easterly flow.</p>
<p>An upper trough passing through after midnight will turn the precipitation more showery early Monday morning and allow snow levels to settle into the 4000-4500' range (a bit cooler north of L. Chelan) and be accompanied blustery W-SW ridgeline winds. The heaviest post-frontal showers will likely be directed at the Mt Baker area late tonight. </p>
<p>Upper level ridging will build over the inland NW on Monday and Monday morning showers will taper off. Freezing levels will bump up, especially for areas west of the Cascade crest and Mt Hood in the afternoon.  We should see some sunshine mid-day before high clouds from the next system approaches. </p>
<p>SE winds from this next system will crank up rapidly Monday afternoon and the next round of precipitation will arrive Monday night. This frontal band will shear apart as it pushes inland, delivering moderate precipitation to most areas except higher precipitation totals for the south WA Cascades and Mt Hood.  Showers will follow on Tuesday with an upper level trough overhead.  </p>
