<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's shaping up to be a beautiful day in the mountains with mostly sunny skies, generally light winds, and warming temperatures. A high pressure ridge off the coast keeps us dry for the next several days. However, a storm system to our north will occasionally send bands of clouds across the area. Today, these clouds should be the most prominent in the Mt Baker area, where you could even see a few flurries from time to time. </p>
<p>The ridge begins to expand and flop to the east this afternoon and evening. This will allow much warmer air to push into the region, sending freezing levels on a steady upward march. Cold dense air in the mountain valleys, particularly east of the Cascades, becomes capped by the overriding warm air, creating temperature inversions and the chance for multiple freezing levels. Easterly flow in the passes will make this even more pronounced. As a result, freezing level values will paint a poor picture of conditions this week. A passing wave of clouds this evening could limit the development of fog and low clouds. It also might provide just enough extra energy for some very light upslope snow showers in the East North and Central zones. </p>
<p>It may be very chilly at the trailheads on Monday morning, but you might just be shedding layers as you head up the hill. Much warmer air will continue to raise temperatures at higher elevations. Overall, this pattern of mostly sunny days, passing bands, of clouds, warming higher elevations, and temperature inversions repeats over and over for the next several days. </p>
