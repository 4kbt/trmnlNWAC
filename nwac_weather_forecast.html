<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The December subtropical connection is in its final days, but it won't quit without more significant rainfall and another atmospheric river.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, high clouds spread into the region with a narrow band of briefly moderate rainfall moving into the region overnight. This band reaches Hurricane Ridge around 10PM, Mt Baker by around midnight, and Snoqualmie Pass around 4 AM. The rain band peters out as it moves SE through the morning hours, barely reaching Mt. Hood in the afternoon. A convergence could develop over the northern Cascades or the Mountain Loop as the day progresses, keeping precipitation in the forecast up north. Snow levels hover around 6000-7000 ft, with limited cooling behind the front as an atmospheric river approaches our offshore waters. Mt Baker gets the most of the unwanted water (around 0.7"), with other areas receiving around 0.25" or less.</p>
<p>The main atmospheric river approaches as a low moves toward Heida Guaii, spreading a wide swath of moisture-laden air directly toward Washington State on a brisk SSW flow. This is a different flow pattern than the previous atmospheric river so that Mt Baker will be more favored. However, weak E flow should help wring out the moisture on the E slopes of the Cascades as well. Expect moderate to strong winds and heavy precipitation for many areas from late Sunday night through Monday, with the trailing cold front reaching the coastline during the afternoon.</p>
