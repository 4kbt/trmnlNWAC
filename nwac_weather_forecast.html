<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A relatively weak and narrow atmospheric river has taken aim at Vancouver Island this morning. The main band of precipitation is clipping the Olympic Mountains and North Cascades setting up quite a difference between these areas and the rest of our forecast region. Near and under this fire hose you'll find very storm conditions with periods of heavy rain and snow combined with very strong and gusty southerly winds. </p>
<p>A bit of precipitation is spilling further south than initially expected this morning. Don't be surprised if you encounter very light drizzle near Stevens or Snoqualmie Pass to start the day. However, all this moisture will lift north mid-morning relegating any showers to places adjacent to the main event like the East North and West Central zones.  Strong winds will be more common across the entire region. Expect gusty ridgeline winds, with the strongest wind speeds near Hurricane Ridge, Mt Baker, Mt Saint Helens, and Mt Hood. While most places should stay cloudy on Saturday, overcast skies could thin a bit in the southern zones and near Mt Hood. This could result in filtered sunshine or maybe even some sun breaks. </p>
<p>This evening, the trough associated with the atmospheric river digs further south and becomes more N-S oriented. This should lift the bulk of the precipitation north of the border. However, ridgelines winds will remain strong and gusty. On Sunday, the trough splits in half as the storm tries to push inland. This will limit the available moisture for our region. Weather models still disagree about when exactly the system will move onshore. While there are still plenty of details to work out, it's a safe bet that areas further north have a better chance at significant precipitation in the afternoon than locations further south. </p>
