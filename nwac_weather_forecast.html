<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#142d56">The weekend's first half features the tail end of our cold and snowy pattern. It wonâ€™t last as our region transitions to warm and wet weather. The frontal wave over southern portions of the forecast region shifts eastward early Friday evening. In its wake, a comma cloud moves onshore, reaching the Cascades for heavier and more sustained precipitation in the late evening hours. It arrives with a strong push of W winds, gradual cooling, and snow levels lowering from 3500 to 2000 ft by Saturday morning. While most areas experience decreasing light to moderate snow showers overnight, convergence maintains a narrow band of heavier snowfall in the vicinity of Stevens Pass, potentially bringing overnight totals there to 8-14". Most other areas west of the Cascade Crest can expect 3-10" while areas east of the Cascade Crest can expect 2-6". A weak ridge on Saturday brings decreasing light to moderate W winds and a tapering of light snow showers along the west slopes of the Cascades. Expect partial sunshine in the mid-day hours before mid-level clouds increase and thicken late in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#142d56">A weak atmospheric river initially brings light rain and snow on Saturday night with models trending towards this arriving a few hours earlier than originally forecast. Widespread moderate to heavy precipitation peaks on Sunday as snow levels rise to 4500-7000 ft by the afternoon. Strong S winds initially focus on Mt Baker early Sunday, then shift WSW getting most areas into the stormy conditions. </span></p>
