<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The high-pressure center just offshore just won't go away, but it will begin to gradually weaken. The light N winds aloft, rounding the high pressure, continue to have little impact on surface conditions except on the volcanoes. The bigger impact remains the subsidence and warming associated with the broad pattern. This cold within the cold pool east of the Cascades has become even colder. Its depth has been deeper in northern portions of the forecast region (mainly below 4000 ft at Snoqualmie Pass, 5000 ft at Stevens Pass, and 6000 ft at Washington Pass).  Widespread stratus persists across the Columbia Basin with fingers spreading into deeper valleys throughout the east slopes of the Cascades, reaching as far west as Snoqualmie Pass, and may not fully burn off at the Pass on Sunday. This trend is likely to continue until we get more upper-level mixing on Monday, starting Monday night.</p>
<p>The colder air at low levels continues to drive a moderate pressure gradient and low-level E flow through the mountain gaps. Expect moderate ridgeline winds in localized areas near the Cascade Crest from around Snoqualmie Pass southward, but with the most significant winds in the Snoqualmie Pass corridor. </p>
<p>We're not expecting much change in the pattern through Monday other than a very subtle lowering for freezing levels from 10,500-12,000 ft on Sunday to 9,000-11,000 ft over the next 24 hours. Mostly light WNW winds develop late Monday and peak in the early morning hours on Tuesday as upper-level winds shift more NWerly. Low-level gradients are likely to continue to drive some E flow through the mountain gaps, but expect some erosion of the cold pool east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
