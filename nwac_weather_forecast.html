<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A broad upper-level trough will pass through the area in the wake of a system moving eastward through Oregon. This trough will keep moderate snowfall going over the Mt Hood area through mid-morning. Light showers/low clouds linger along the west slopes of the Cascades. The back edge of the trough brings some cloud cover to areas of the east slopes of the Cascades near the Cascade Crest as well.  The switch to westerly onshore flow will also initiate a warming trend.  Snow levels will bump up to 1500-2500', and mid-mountain high temperatures will push into the 20s throughout the area.  Ridgeline winds will become moderate to locally strong out of the W-WNW Friday afternoon, focusing on Mt Hood and the E slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>A few light showers continue mainly along the west slopes of Cacades and will continue Friday night along with moderate to strong W ridgeline winds. A more organized frontal system will push closer to the coast on Saturday, with light warm frontal precipitation pushing over the area in the mid-day and afternoon hours.  Snow levels in the 1000-3000 ft range. </p>
