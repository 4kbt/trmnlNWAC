<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A ridge over the West Coast shifts east on Thursday as a warm front brings a light band of steadier precipitation to NW Washington. That band is bringing rain rates up to 0.15" per hour over the 542 corridor west around Mt Baker as it lifts north into Canada. Expect mild air to continue flowing into the region on a SSW flow with light showers continuing for the Olympics and portions of the west slopes of the Cascades through the afternoon.</p>
<p>The ridge aloft has created inversion conditions east of the Cascades with a cold pool thickening as the day progresses and E low-level flow increases in the light to moderate range. This could create a wintry mix for any precipitation spilling over into the passes.</p>
<p>A modest trailing cold frontal precipitation band will impact the mountains of Washington State during the evening hours. In most areas, precipitation will be light, but Moderate to occasionally strong SSW winds peak around Mt Baker and will help squeeze out a period of heavy rainfall before precipitation rapidly tapers overnight. Washington Pass could pick up 1-6" of snowfall during this time frame, with upslope snowfall potentially bringing accumulations to lower elevations. Precipitation further south is more likely to be mixed as warm air spreads in aloft.</p>
<p>Shortwave ridging brings the region a mostly dry morning on Friday. Temperatures remain unseasonably mild with freezing levels around 10,000 ft for the Olympics, Mt Hood, and the southern Washington Cascades. Light rain and highest elevation snow spreads back into the Olympics Friday afternoon as clouds thicken over the Cascades in the afternoon ahead of the next shortwave feature.</p>
