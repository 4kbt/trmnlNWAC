<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper level ridge over the West Coast led to a mild and partly to mostly sunny day with periods of filtered sunshine from high clouds drifting over the region. Locally breezy conditions seen today will become more widespread tonight through Thursday as a weak weather disturbance passes inland over British Columbia. This weak weather feature will cause an uptick in W-SW winds, especially near and above the Cascade crest level over Washington, with lighter winds for Mt Hood.  We'll see more passing high clouds tonight and may see some lower clouds affect the Olympics and northwest Cascades late tonight through Thursday morning.  Freezing levels will remain largely unchanged, and the switch to westerly flow tomorrow will actually help bump on temperatures along the east slopes of the Cascades versus today.   </p>
<p>The upper level ridge will quickly rebuild Thursday night and shift east of the Cascades on Friday.  Expect continued dry and mild weather to end the workweek. Winds will be lighter along with mostly sunny skies. </p>
