<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak upper level shortwave passed through the region last night bringing some very light precipitation (likely an inch or less of snow) to the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes along with falling temperatures. The flow aloft is becoming northerly and it quickly ushering in a clearing trend with much drier air moving in at all areas. We'll see low clouds hang on this morning along the west slopes of the Cascades near and south of Hwy 2 to Mt Hood (and along the northern slopes of the Olympics) before joining the rest of the region in mostly sunny skies.  Look for brisk NE ridgeline winds, strongest near the Canadian border today. After a cool start, freezing levels will rebound into the 2500-3500' range today. </p>
<p>Strong upper level ridging will nose over the PNW and British Columbia this weekend while a cold upper level trough digs over California. We should see mostly clear skies on Saturday with a slow warming trend.  The coolest temperatures will be in the Passes, along the east slopes of the Cascades and down near Mt Hood closer to the upper low. We'll also see slightly stronger NE ridgeline winds tomorrow in this pattern as well.  </p>
