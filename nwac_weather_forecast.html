<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An atmospheric river arrives with a warm front moving into the area on Tuesday. A shield of rain and snow extends from Victoria, BC to Seattle, and to areas of the Cascades south of I-90 at 7 AM as it lifts NE. This will bring light precipitation with snow levels around 3500-4500 ft west of the Cascades and at valley bottoms east of the Cascades and through the mountain gaps. Precipitation rapidly ramps up into the moderate to heavy range throughout the central and southern Cascades this morning, and particularly the Olympics. The precipitation also reaches the northern Cascades by the late morning hours (a few hours ahead of yesterday's forecast). SSW flow will bring significant warming, initially to the Olympics and southern Cascades during the afternoon hours with snow levels rising to near the Cascade Crest in these areas late in the day. The timing of the warmup remains an area of significant uncertainty.</p>
<p>Moderate to heavy rain, snow, and freezing rain continue as warm air rides over the cold air entrenched east of the Cascades and through the mountain gaps. Expect around 50% of the precipitation falling around Snoqualmie Pass, Stevens Pass, and areas further east to be in the form of freezing rain Tuesday night. That means rain will fall in a layer above these freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>A cold front moves through early Wednesday morning, shifting winds from SSW to W and bringing an end to the steady precipitation. Temperatures gradually cool with snow levels lowering to 3500-5500 ft in the afternoon after topping out around 7500-8000 ft Tuesday night.</p>
