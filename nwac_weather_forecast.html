<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The fire hose from Sunday/Monday's atmospheric river fizzled and drifted north of the border today, leaving the PNW with mostly sunny skies and unseasonably warm temperatures. Mild temperature will hold tonight through Wednesday, with daytime mountain high temperatures once again pushing into the 40s/50s and even the odd 60F.  We'll see a few high clouds tonight through Wednesday morning slip under an upper-level ridge, with otherwise clear skies. </p>
<p>While Wednesday will start off mostly sunny, the atmospheric ingredients are in place for convective weather, which will include heavier showers and thunderstorms. Scattered showers may flare up over the Olympics, Mt Hood, and southwest Washington Cascades by midday Wednesday, but the heaviest showers should flare up later Wednesday afternoon as a frontal boundary approaches. While all areas will see precipitation Wednesday night, the heaviest showers will likely form near and to the west of the Cascade crest and near Mt Hood and drift from the south to the north.  The highest chances for heavy showers/strong thunderstorms featuring strong gusty winds, hail and lightning exist west of the Cascade crest during this period. If you're planning to be out in the mountains on Wednesday, make a plan to avoid getting caught out in stronger storms. </p>
<p>A stacked upper low will drift closer to the coast on Thursday, keeping scattered showers, breezy winds, and the chance for afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast.  Snow levels will begin to slowly decline Wednesday night through Thursday, but temperatures will still be near or above freezing in many locations. </p>
