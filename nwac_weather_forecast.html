<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest will be under the influence of a broad upper level trough today.  The trough is positioned off our coast and will rotate up a few showers and clouds today from the south. Areas slightly closer to the trough's influence, from I-90 and southward to Mt Hood, may see more convective shower activity in the afternoon through early evening. Freezing levels will rise to around 4500', but expect snow levels to fall to 3500-4000' with precipitation. </p>
<p>As the broad upper level trough pushes in the southwestern US tonight, skies will clear from north to south, with cloudier conditions hanging on for Mt Hood through the night. Upper level ridging upstream over British Columbia will shift closer to our area on Thursday.  While we'll have dry weather on Thursday, look for northerly winds to make for breezy conditions along ridgelines and higher peaks.  Freezing levels will top out around 5000-5500'.  We should also see some a few cumulus clouds pop up in the afternoon, particularly along the west slopes of the Cascades. </p>
