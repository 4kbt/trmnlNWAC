<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for quite the mild day across the area as high pressure exerts control over the western US and shoves the remnants of an atmospheric river north of the border during the day. The beginning of the day will start out drippy with low clouds from about Snoqualmie Pass and northward along the west slopes of the Cascades, but these low clouds will break up later this morning on our way to mostly sunny skies. Occasional high clouds will give the appearance of filtered sunshine at times. </p>
<p>Temperatures are already well above freezing at all mountain weather stations, and those mild temperatures will climb during the day, with 5000' high temperatures peaking in the upper 40s to low 50s this afternoon.  These mild temperatures will be accompanied by 11,000-13,000' freezing levels. </p>
<p>Mild temperatures and mostly clear skies will continue Tuesday night through Wednesday morning. We should see some patchy valley fog and near the Cascade Passes as well with generally light winds and clear skies.  A weak weather system will sputter out before reaching the Pacific Northwest Wednesday afternoon. We may see an increase in cloud cover for northern zones and an increase in westerly ridgeline winds in the mid-to-late afternoon.  </p>
