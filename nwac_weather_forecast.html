<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak upper low is diving south into Oregon this morning and spinning up light bands of precipitation from south to north over the Mt Hood area, the southern Washington Cascades and southern Olympics. These areas will see periods of light snow that peter out during the day. Areas that saw strong SE winds overnight like Crystal Mt and Snoqualmie Pass, will see those winds diminish quickly this morning as ridgeline winds become WSW.  Those same areas saw an impressive drop in temperatures at 5000', some areas are 15F colder than yesterday morning. Snow levels and temperatures will slightly warmer west of the Cascade crest today for areas like Mt Baker and over the Olympics. </p>
<p>We'll see a few showers continue tonight, especially over the west central and west north zones as the upper longwave trough passes through.  A much stronger frontal system will approach the area on Friday.  Light warm frontal precipitation will begin in most areas in the afternoon, becoming more moderate in some areas before sunset.  A bigger story will be the winds that ramp up in advance of this system, becoming strong in many areas out of the S or SE. </p>
