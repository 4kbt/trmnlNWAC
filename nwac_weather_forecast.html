<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Isolated to scattered afternoon showers, especially prevalent over the south Washington Cascades and Mt Hood, will peter out this evening. Most areas will clear tonight as a broad upper level trough and its associated cloud cover pull further away from the PNW. </p>
<p>Upper level ridging will inch closer into British Columbia on Thursday, leaving us with dry northerly flow aloft. Freezing levels will climb into the 5000-6000' range on Thursday. N-NW winds shouldn't be overly strong, but expect to encounter occasionally moderate ridgeline winds. We'll likely see some afternoon cumulus buildup near and west of the Cascade crest, making for a few afternoon clouds.  Thursday night should be mostly clear as well. </p>
<p>On Friday, the upper level ridge will shift east of the Cascades and begin to flatten as an atmospheric river starts to take shape to our north. Expect mild conditions, with the warmest temperatures for areas to the south, and perhaps some increased cloud cover for the Olympics and northwest Cascades during the day.  </p>
