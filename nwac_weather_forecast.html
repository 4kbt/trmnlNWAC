<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We'll run back a familiar pattern that's been with us since Thursday, impulses of precipitation and bursts of moderate to locally strong southerly winds, will continue Saturday night, and again Sunday morning, before the precipitation becomes more showery Sunday afternoon. Snow levels and precipitation types in southerly flow aloft remain difficult to pin down.</p>
<p>Milder snow levels 4500-5000' will be found west of the Cascade Crest and Olympics. The coldest of air along the east slopes of the Cascades has long been scoured out, but there's just enough easterly flow to make the Passes tricky. For White and Snoqualmie Passes, periods of light precipitation tonight may take the form of light rain, snow, or freezing rain at Pass level.  Stevens is more likely to stay light snow. Along the east slopes of the Cascades, snow levels will generally run 2000-4000' (milder south of I-90), with pockets of freezing rain that may occur along lower slopes and valleys. The heaviest precipitation tonight is likely to occur near the southern volcanoes (Mt St Helens, Adams, and Mt Hood). </p>
<p>Another upper level shortwave moves through Sunday morning, and this one should bring a more widespread and organized period of moderate precipitation across the region. The Passes are more likely to see all snow during this stretch.  </p>
<p>We'll be in a showery pattern with generally lighter precipitation rates and breezy W-SW winds Sunday afternoon as snow levels settle between 3500-4000'.  </p>
