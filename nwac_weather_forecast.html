<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>There's no real way to sugarcoat it; conditions are warm, wet, and windy across most of the forecast region this afternoon. A few trailheads like Mt Baker, Hurricane Ridge, and Wa Pass have managed to fend off the change over to rain, but that probably won't last the night. An atmospheric river (AR) continues to pump a stream of moisture into the region along with very strong winds, periods of heavy precipitation, and warming temperatures. </p>
<p>The pattern doesn't change much Sunday night. Very strong to extreme winds peak in most areas this evening with significant gusts. Rain and high elevation snow will continue to be heavy at times near and west of the Cascade crest. While showers will make their way to the eastern portions of the forecast area, they become less common and lighter. Warm air continues to move into the region keeping snow levels climbing up the hillsides. This warming will be felt the most in areas that stayed colder on Sunday. Ultimately rain should reach into the upper elevations for most forecast zones. </p>
<p>The AR shifts northward slightly on Monday and begins to weaken. Northern areas should remain stormy, but precipitation rates and winds will be a full notch lower than Sunday. Further south and east there will be a much more marked change with showers steadily decreasing throughout the day. For most locations, the storm will keep skies cloudy, but on the southern edge of the region, near Mt Hood, there could be a few sun breaks in the afternoon. Admittedly, Monday's forecast is tricky. Precipitation depends largely on just how far north the AR moves.</p>
<p>The storm continues to wind down and shift northward Monday night. Showers taper from south to north as a high pressure ridge builds into the Pacific Northwest. By Tuesday morning lingering showers should be confined to near the Canadian border. Even if you encounter a few clouds to start the day, the trend will be for drying and clearing. While it may be nice to say goodbye to the rain, the warm temperatures will hang with us. </p>
