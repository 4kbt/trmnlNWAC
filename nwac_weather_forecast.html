<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>With the biggest storm of the Holiday week behind us, we remain in an active pattern with temperatures slightly above seasonal norms as systems rotate into the area every 12-24 hours around a deep, broad Aleutian Low.</p>
<p>Light to occasional moderate rain and snow shower activity continues on W flow Thursday evening, mostly near and west of the Cascade Crest. The next system approaches southern Washington State with a warm front advancing as it moves from W to E. This system will bring moderate to occasionally heavy rain and snow to the Southern Cascade Volcanoes with precipitation reaching the central Cascades in the early morning hours. Most of the snow accumulations will be above 3000-3500 ft and south of I-90. However, some snowfall will lift as far north as Washington Pass by mid-morning on Friday before the snowfall retreats southward, becoming showery by the afternoon.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of the Friday morning system, a somewhat stronger low rotates toward Vancouver Island Friday night. Moderate rain and snow move into the Olympics Friday afternoon and reach portions of the Cascades by the end of the day. Expect moderate rain and snow overnight with post-frontal snow showers on Saturday. WSW flow should focus on the heaviest precipitation on the west slopes of the Cascades. Snow levels will fluctuate, but remain mostly in the 3000-3500 ft range.</p>
