<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A very weak ridge Tuesday night will enable very light snow showers and flurries to trickle into the Olympics and southern Cascades during the evening hours. Expect partial clearing west of the Cascade Crest with mostly clear skies further east. This should yield a cool start to the day on Wednesday. A warm front lifting NE over the Olympics and the northern half of the Cascades will spawn light rain and snow in these areas. Increasing low-level E wind will touch off light snowfall along the E slopes of the Cascades from around White Pass northward. Meanwhile, increasing moderate to occasionally S winds will favor Mt Baker for moderate snowfall in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The cold front pivots into the region Wednesday night, with winds and moderate precipitation peaking across the region. Snow levels rise to around 3000 ft in the north and 4000 ft in the south Wednesday evening before dropping after the late evening frontal passage through the Cascades. Post-frontal decreasing light to moderate snow showers continue through Thursday. Models highlight the potential for convergence, focusing on the mountain loop at times during this period. Moderate to strong W develops behind the front for Mt Hood and the E slopes of the Cascades but gradually decreases on Thursday as snow levels lower to around 2500 ft.</p>
