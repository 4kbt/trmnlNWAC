<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A frontal system is slowly making its way onshore this afternoon with moderate snow and winds over the Olympics.  This front will steadily march inland, bringing several hours of moderate precipitation to most areas, with showers then quickly tapering off before sunrise. The Mt Baker area looks poised to pick up the most snowfall overnight, in the 10-12" range, thanks in part to strong SSW flow, with other areas picking up 2-8". Strong southerly winds in many areas will also fall off later tonight. </p>
<p>Tuesday will be a transition day with perhaps a few showers lingering in the morning hours, and otherwise a lull between weather systems. A warm front coming up from the south will spread extensive mid/high clouds over most of the area during the day.  The Olympics and northwest Cascades may be on the edge of the cloud cover and see sunbreaks for the better part of the day.  S-SE ridgeline winds will creep up in the afternoon as easterly offshore graidents begin to increase. </p>
<p>Tuesday night, light warm frontal precipitation will begin to work from south to north over the area, and linger over the north Cascades on Wednesday.  There's considerable uncertainty regarding the track of the low-pressure system, but the favored solution(s) bring the low north along the OR/WA coast on Wednesday as it tracks north.  S-SE winds should become strong Tuesday night, and areas west of the Cascade crest, plus the Olympics, could see extreme winds Wednesday afternoon.  The warm front will bring a decent shot of snow initially to the east slopes of the Cascades Tuesday night and lighter snow elsewhere.  However, this system could end with a thud, with a warming trend leading to some light rain or drizzle into mid-elevations Wednesday. </p>
