<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><strong>430pm update</strong>: Nudged precipitation amounts up for Mt Hood, East South and East Central precipitation points for Friday</p>
<p>The remnants of a weak frontal system will send a few shower bands over the area tonight, leading to anywhere from a few flurries to an inch or two of snow.  A much stronger system will make its presence felt on Friday with warm frontal precipitation moving over the Olympics in the morning and moving inland during the afternoon. The bulk of the precipitation will hold off until Friday evening and night, but we'll see light snow developing on both sides of the Cascades Friday afternoon. Strong S-SE winds will develop over the Olympics, and more generally along the west slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>Heavier precipitation will begin Friday evening and continue overnight as the frontal band pushes from the coast and largely stalls over western WA. Due to the orientation of this storm, the heaviest precipitation will favor the volcanoes, the S/SE slopes of the Olympics and and to a lesser extent the east slopes of the Cascades with lower totals for the Passes. Snow levels will be plenty low for snow at all lower elevation trailheads, except over the Olympics and Mt Hood were snow levels will hang around 4000' or so.</p>
<p>A secondary upper level feature will rotate from the parent low on Saturday. This feature will keep light to moderate showers going and bring about a switch to more westerly winds. Snow totals through Saturday afternoon will likely be in the 6-12" range with Mt Baker a likely candidate to exceed 1' of snow and on the lower end near the Cascade Passes.  </p>
