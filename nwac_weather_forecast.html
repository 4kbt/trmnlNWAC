<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a mild and mostly sunny day in the mountains with a strong ridge of high pressure in control. Persistent W-NW ridgeline winds have becoming lighter over the northern and central WA Cascades with just plain light winds further south. Look for mid-mountain temperatures in the 40s and even 50s today with sunshine. Steeper inversions with colder low-elevation temperatures can be found along the east slopes of the Cascades, especially near and north of Hwy2.  A low stratus cloud deck over eastern WA is getting pulled up to Snoqualmie Pass but should stay east of the higher Passes like Stevens and White.</p>
<p>The upper level ridge over the area will flatten tonight as a frontal system begins to slide south. Unfortunately, this system is moisture starved and won't bring much in the way of snow by the time it arrives on Thursday.  We'll see light snow develop Thursday morning along the west slopes of the Cascades near and north of I-90 where we may see 1-2" of snow before sunset. We'll see a trace to nothing for areas not far east of the crest or further south. While there's a better chance you'll see cloudy conditions along the west slopes of the Cascades on Thursday, near and south of I-90, there could be patchy freezing drizzle instead of light snow.  Finally, this system will feature a quick ramp up in westerly winds Wednesday night, becoming strong on Thursday.  </p>
