<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a period of anomalously warm weather for mid-January, a sharp cold front returned temperatures to near seasonal norms on Thursday. Expect further cooling in the short term. We'll feel the peripheral impacts of an arctic outbreak targeting the middle of the continent as we move into a below-normal temperature regime over the weekend.</p>
<p>Thursday's sharp front arrived with moderate to strong W and WNW wind targeting areas near and east of the Cascade Crest, and most notably, Mt Hood. Those winds should ease significantly Thursday evening upper-level flow shifts NNWerly. However, strong winds will linger longest in upper-elevation areas such as the volcanoes. There's just enough low-level moisture for a few very light showers to linger around Crystal Mountain in the early evening hours. Expect clearing skies across the region overnight with 5000 ft temperatures dropping to approximately 20F in most areas.</p>
<p>Cool NNW flow dominates the weather pattern Friday through Saturday, ushering in gradually cooler temperatures, particularly at lower elevations thanks to the help of light to moderate Fraser Outflow winds bringing air from the British Columbia interior toward NW Washington. Friday and Saturday should be mostly sunny very chilly starts to the day and light ridgeline winds in most areas. However, don't be surprised to find some moderate wind gusts on the south sides of the volcanoes. Light E winds develop Friday night focusing the colder air near and east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
