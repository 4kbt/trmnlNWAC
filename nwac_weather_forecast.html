<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>SSW flow continues to bring moisture into the Pacific Northwest ahead of a cold front slowly approaching the coastline. An initial N-S oriented rain band should exit the Cascades by 7 or 8 AM. Some areas will experience a relative break embedded in the frontal boundary, bringing steadier precipitation from SSW to NNE from the mid-morning through afternoon hours. Most areas will receive light rain and snow, but the volcanoes and other areas favored by the flow direction should expect moderate amounts. Snow levels should rise within the 3000-4000 ft range, peaking in the early afternoon and may be slightly lower E of the Cascade Crest with light upslope E flow.</p>
<p>A more substantial frontal wave currently off the California coast tracks toward the region overnight, bringing another period of moderate precipitation into the region. This feature tracks east of the Cascades, maintaining SE flow ahead of it, but flow switches W in its wake during the early morning hours as snow levels drop below Snoqualmie Pass. In the Mt Hood area, ridgeline winds will be strong through mid-morning Wednesday, tapering slightly in the afternoon. On Thursday, light to moderate and increasingly convective shower activity continues with drastically lower snow levels (1000-2000 ft). Thunderstorms remain possible in the afternoon, particularly in southern portions of the forecast region. Locally heavy precipitation is likely in convergence bands focusing on the Mountain Loop or Mt Baker areas.</p>
