<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A long-duration winter storm will impact the region through Monday. The storm will bring a return to more typical temperatures with the lowlands back firmly in the "rain" category. However, the mountains will pick significant snowfall.</p>
<p>Warm frontal moisture continues to lift through the northern Cascades early Saturday evening, while the southern half experiences a break in the action in the "warm sector" of the storm. Moderate SW ridgeline winds will buffet the Olympics, Mt Baker, and southern Cascade volcanoes as the primary front approaches and then moves through overnight with moderate to locally heavy rain and snow. Snow levels should rise to around 2500-4500 ft west of the Cascade Crest, but should be 1500 ft lower further east and through the Cascade gaps as light to moderate E flow peaks.</p>
<p>Moderate rain and snow continue with SW flow as an upper low shifts SE. Precipitation gradually becomes more showery as the day progresses. Snow levels remain in the 3500-4500 ft range for the west slopes of the Cascades but rise progressively east of the Cascades.</p>
<p>A secondary pulse of moisture arrives Sunday night, bringing heavy rain and snow to the southern half of the Cascades with more modest precipitation further north. Moderate ridgeline winds target Mt Hood, the mountain gaps, and the east slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>On Monday, precipitation will become light to moderate and showery as the upper low moves onshore. The focus of precipitation and decreasing winds will remain on the southern Cascades.</p>
