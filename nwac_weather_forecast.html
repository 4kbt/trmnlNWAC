<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A warm front will lift northwards today from Oregon into Washington, spreading light to locally moderate precipitation into the Mt Hood region and the south WA Cascades during the day. Precipitation will be slow to reach the northern Cascades but even there, precipitation will begin during the afternoon hours. S-SE winds will locally be strongest along west slopes of the Cascades and Olymipcs.  Snow levels will come down to 4000-5000' when precipitation begins.  </p>
<p>The most impactful weather feature arrives tonight. A secondary weather feature associated with the same deep low pressure system will move onshore overnight, delivering a potent round of intense precipitation and strong to extreme winds through Tuesday morning. Snow levels will fall to 3000-3500' during the heaviest precipitation with accumulations likely totaling 6-18" through mid-day Tuesday. Showers will continue along the west slopes of the Cascade but slowly taper off Tuesday afternoon.  The winds will have a similar slow easing trend during the day Tuesday. </p>
