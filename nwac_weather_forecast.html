<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A multi-day atmospheric river event will unfold through the work week. While models indicate broad agreement on the magnitude of the event, subtle fluctuations in snow level and the aim of the firehose will determine how this event goes down in the record books and snowpack gain/loss category.</p>
<p>Brisk upper-level W winds will maintain moderate to locally strong WSW winds across the region Sunday night, with enough moisture to continue light rain and higher-elevation snow shower activity. With low-level flow switching back westerly Sunday afternoon, the passes won't be able to look forward to more surprise wet snowfall.</p>
<p>The main event of the atmospheric river reaches the coast in the early morning hours on Monday, pushing inland as the morning progresses. This will spread rapidly increasing precipitation throughout the region which will become heavy in the 7-10 AM time frame and very heavy through the remainder of the day. Snow levels rise to 6000-8000 ft by the afternoon as moderate to strong winds increase. It will be a miserable day on both sides of the Cascades as plenty of moisture spills over the Cascade Crest.</p>
<p>Peak warming likely occurs in the early evening hours before a cold frontal system drops southward, bringing cooling and rapidly decreasing precipitation from north to south on Monday night. This cooling lasts through the day on Tuesday. Elevations above around 5,000 ft from Mt Rainier northward could pick up 6" or more of snow with the cooling while the southern Cascades continue to experience heavy precipitation and only minor reductions in snow level.</p>
