<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A strong ridge of high pressure will begin to flatten today as pacific frontal system spreads intermittent high clouds over the area today.  Freezing levels and temperatures will generally be mild with a few caveats.  Easterly flow will continue to drag low clouds and cold temperatures through the Passes.  Low clouds should break up for Stevens and White Pass but may stick around for our lower Pass, Snoqualmie. In a similar vein, the east slopes of the Cascades will start off cooler but milder air will punch through to mid and upper elevations as westerly flow aloft increases.</p>
<p>As the upper level ridge flattens we will see some light precipitation glance the north and central Cascades overnight into early Wednesday morning. There could be some light flurries or even freezing drizzle for areas that do see precipitation.  Westerly ridgeline winds will also become moderate later this afternoon through tomorrow and expect even stronger W-NW winds in the alpine.  </p>
<p>The upper level ridge will begin to rebuild on Wednesday with clearing skies.  Freezing levels will rebound except for slightly cooler conditions sticking around closer to the Canadian border. </p>
