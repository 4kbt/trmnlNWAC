<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a wet and stormy 2nd half of December, we'll close out 2024 on a dry note today as an upper level ridge slides over the area. Mountain weather stations are reporting some of the coldest temperatures in some time, with many stations near or above 5000' in the teens this morning.  Freezing levels will rebound to 3000-3500' this afternoon with partly sunny skies in the morning giving way to filtered sunshine and a high overcast later this afternoon.  Cool easterly flow will drag low clouds along the east slope of the Cascades through Snoqualmie Pass, and along the eastern approaches for Stevens and White Passes. Ridgeline winds should tick up towards the 10-15mph range this afternoon as a frontal system approaches the coast. </p>
<p>A Pacific frontal system will undercut the ridge tonight and spread light precipitation into northern Oregon and up through much of Washington. This system will be unremarkable snow-wise, but snow levels will be quite low, with snow accumulating between 1000-2000' Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. We'll see light post-frontal showers on New Year's Day with some clearing mid-day and afternoon. High clouds from the next frontal system will be on our doorstep before sunset Wednesday. </p>
