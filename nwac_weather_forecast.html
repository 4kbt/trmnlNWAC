<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Warm and mostly clear weather predominates across the PNW mountains through the weekend. A closed low moves from California into the Great Basin, maintaining a split flow pattern for our region. This yields light winds aloft and mild temperatures. However, a strong W-to-E pressure gradient sets up conditions for a marine deck to form again Saturday night. Unlike Saturday morning when the marine deck generally retreated by noon, a stronger marine push on Sunday could keep these low clouds around through much of the afternoon, the Puget Sound lowlands and foothills of the Cascades south of the mountain loop. This makes it a great time to get above the 2000 ft cloud deck and enjoy the sunny skies in the mountains. The secondary impact of the pressure gradient will be gusty winds for the eastern foothills of the Cascades through Monday. Gusts could be strong to extreme downwind of mountain gaps, such as in the mountains near Ellensburg.</p>
<p>NW ridgeline winds gradually increase as ridging moves over the Pacific Northwest Sunday afternoon through early Monday. This will decrease the potential for a marine push Sunday night and Monday morning. However, expect an increase in cloud cover over northern Washington as a weak frontal system approaches from the northwest.</p>
<p>Freezing levels remain above seasonal norms (in the 7000-9500 ft range) with the highest freezing levels in southern portions of the forecast region on Monday.</p>
