<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Warm and quiet weather continues through the weekend, but expect a gradual cooling trend and increasing onshore flow. A cutoff low dropping southward toward California continues to spin some high clouds into our region from the south. Friday's 9000 ft freezing levels linger into the evening hours before onshore flow begins the previously mentioned cooling trend. By Saturday, the cooler air off the ocean lowers freezing levels by 1000–2000 ft. Expect temperatures around 5- 10°F cooler west of the Cascade Crest, with little change further east, as typical springtime breezy and gusty downslope winds increase. Skies should be mostly sunny in the morning, but very modest cloud buildup in the afternoon could touch off a stray shower.</p>
<p>The cooling trend continues through the weekend, with 5000 ft high temperatures on Sunday more typical for late April, in the 30s and 40s. A marine stratus deck could push into the Puget Sound interior and west slopes of the Cascades Saturday night; this may linger Sunday morning as light to moderate WNW ridgeline and low-level W winds continue to increase. Daytime warming will likely make the cloud cover scattered by the afternoon as freezing levels rise to around 6000-6500 ft. The cooling trend should begin to impact areas east of the Crest.</p>
