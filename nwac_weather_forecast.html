<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A front passed through the Cascades early Saturday morning. Vigorous rain and snow showers continue in its wake. Moderate to locally strong WSW winds switching W in the afternoon will make these showers feel more like steady precipitation with fluctuating intensity over the mountains. Expect slightly above average temperatures with snow levels bumping up to 3500-4000 ft as cooler air east of the Cascades gets scoured out. Already Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes have transitioned to rain. The winds will continue through the end of the day and will be most impactful near and east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
<p>Rain and snow showers taper Saturday evening. Attention focuses on the next system as low forming off the mouth of the Columbia lifts a moisture-laden warm front to the Washington-Oregon border. This front spreads moderate to heavy rain and snow into areas south of I-90 and light to moderate rain and snow into the central Cascades on Sunday. This system with E flow and a trough moving in from the north should lower snow levels into the 2500-3500 ft range. Steadier snowfall becomes showery late in the afternoon with moderate to strong W winds rapidly increasing over the southern Cascades late in the day as the trough works southward.</p>
