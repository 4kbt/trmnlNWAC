<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Slow-moving systems typical of late March will impact the region over the next 5 days. The upper low drifting northward of the PNW coastline becomes a weak trough Friday night. It will bring decreasing scattered showers on a gradually decreasing SW flow that favors the west slopes of the Olympics and Washington Volcanoes for 2-4" of snow Cooling temperatures will bring snow levels down to around 3000 ft. The trough axis moves through early Saturday, bringing a round of steadier light rain or snow to the Olympics, Mountain Loop, and Mt Baker. This ends by late morning with a return to decreasing scattered rain and snow showers. The W slopes of the Olympics and Cascades can expect up to 3" of snow during the day. The east slopes of the Cascades can expect decreasing isolated showers and increasing sun breaks. Snow levels hover around 3500 ft as ridgeline winds shift toward the W and decrease.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">A weak ridge of high pressure brings a break between storms and partial clearing Saturday night through much of Sunday. Freezing levels rise to around 5500-6000 ft making for a pleasant springtime day. Clouds increase late Sunday in southern portions of the forecast region as the next system approaches. </span></p>
