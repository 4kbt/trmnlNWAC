<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The last organized weather disturbance in our recent pattern is currently crossing the Olympics this afternoon, and should spread another band of steady precipitation inland later this afternoon and evening. The trailing upper-level trough will focus shower activity on the Olympics, north and central Cascades tonight, and keep the winds in the moderate to locally strong range. With snow levels continuing to slide downwards overnight to 2000-2500', most locations will see an additional few inches of snow, with the higher end at 6-8" for the Mt Baker area. </p>
<p>A brief period of convergence should set up early Monday morning, focusing between Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, adding another few inches to these areas. Shower activity will really taper into Monday afternoon with a break between weather systems.  Mostly cloudy skies with sunbreaks should give way to partly sunny skies along the east slopes of the Cascades and on the eastern side of Mt Hood. </p>
<p>Snow levels will fall to around 1500' Monday night as we await the next storm. Light snow should develop over the Olympics and northern Cascades before daybreak, followed by moderate to heavy snowfall with strong to locally extreme west winds on Tuesday for the Olympics and Washington Cascades. The heavier precipitation may hold off for the Mt Hood area and the far southern WA Cascades. This will be predominantly a snow storm, but we should see a minor snow level rise into the 2500-3500' range from Mt Hood to Snoqualmie Pass ahead of the frontal passage Tuesday afternoon/early evening. </p>
