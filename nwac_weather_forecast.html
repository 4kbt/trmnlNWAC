<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Post-frontal WSW flow aloft gradually weakens as it continues to feed pulses of moisture into our region as the offshore upper low ambles towards the coastline. These pulses are not captured well by the models but will increasingly target primarily the central and southern Cascades from the overnight hours onwards. The first significant pulse moves through Sunday afternoon and evening and then showers associated with the primary upper low will fill in without a break overnight into Monday. This activity peaks late Sunday night and Monday morning before gradually decreasing as upper-level as the low morphs into a trough and then flow switches NNW. Snow levels remain in the 3000-4000 ft range for most areas but rise gradually to this elevation as E flow wanes early Monday for areas near and east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
<p>Shower activity continues for the west slopes of the Cascades Monday night with modest convergence likely lifting north through the central Cascades in the early morning horus on Tuesday as weak ridging builds. Tuesday features a relative break in the action with slightly cooler temperatures and strengthening E flow in the afternoon.</p>
