<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It feels like spring on this final day of meteorological winter. Thanks to a high-pressure ridge over the region, expect warm, dry weather with mostly light SW to SSW winds through Saturday. The most anomalously warm temperatures (15-25 F above normal) gradually shift from the southern to the northern Cascades, with freezing levels ranging from 8000 to 11000 ft. Mostly clear skies continue, but high clouds gradually lower and thicken as the day progresses on Saturday. Dress for cooler temperatures at lower elevations near and east of the Cascade Crest on Saturday morning with increased light low-level E flow. Expect sub-freezing temperatures overnight and into the morning hours below 5500 ft in the Methow Valley.</p>
<p>A closed low tracking southward off the Oregon Coast will bring increasingly breezy conditions to the Mt Baker area on Saturday. The system spreads a band of light rain and snow into the Olympics and Mt Hood areas early Sunday. Much of the precipitation should be directed south of our region. WNW ridgeline winds develop and increase, focusing the potential for increasing very light rain and snow showers on the west slopes of the Cascades as snow levels lower to 4500-5000 ft by the afternoon. Expect warmer, sunnier, and breezier conditions further east.</p>
