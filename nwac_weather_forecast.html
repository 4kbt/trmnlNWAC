<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's another cool and sunny day across most of the forecast area. Expected high clouds hung up in Oregon, but some low level stratus pushed into sections of the West North and Central zone. This evening the high pressure ridge over the eastern Pacific will rebound resulting in decreasing winds, clearing skies, and temperature inversions. You could see patchy low clouds or valley fog, but with such a dry airmass, this will be most common near creeks and lakes near and east of the Cascade Crest. </p>
<p>As the high pressure ridge continues to build, temperatures at the lower levels of the atmosphere become a mess. Neither freezing level nor 5000 ft temperatures paint a clear picture of how warm or cold it may feel. Expect multiple freezing levels with the coldest temperatures often settling into the deep mountain valleys and other cold air sinks in the terrain. Above, the upper atmosphere should continue to steadily warm. Low level offshore (easterly) flow, will only add to this complexity as it tries to draw cold air in from Central Washington keeping much of the lower elevation terrain east of the Crest and in the Passes very chilly. </p>
<p>The pattern repeats itself Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Temperature inversion cool the valleys and passes, while higher in the terrain, milder temperatures prevail. An approaching short-wave disturbance turns the winds more westerly during the day, allowing warmer air to mix down to lower elevations. Ridgeline winds and clouds should increase in the afternoon, but any precipitation appears to hold off until the evening hours. </p>
