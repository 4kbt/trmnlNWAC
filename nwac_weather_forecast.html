<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak upper level trough shifted into eastern WA and Oregon today, leaving us in cool northerly flow aloft. Low temperatures this morning were in the 20s for many locations and have only rebounded into the 30s and low 40s this afternoon. Daytime heating is driving a build-up in afternoon/evening clouds, and we will likely see a few stray mountain showers through early evening. Clouds will quickly clear out later Tuesday evening and overnight but freezing levels will more or less stay steady around 5000-5500' overnight. With light winds and clearing skies, look for temperature inversions with colder temperatures along lower elevations and valleys. </p>
<p>An upper level ridge of high pressure will amplify over the west coast of the PNW and Canada on Wednesday, leading to dry and mild weather. We should see a few afternoon cumulus clouds, but not enough to distract from the abundant sunshine. Afternoon 5000' temperatures will top out in the mid 40s to low 50s.</p>
<p>The ridge will shift east of the Cascades on Thursday as an upper level trough digs well off the coast. We'll see another mild and mostly sunny day with freezing levels rising to 8500'. The one caveat will be a period of offshore flow and light to moderate E-SE winds that develop Wednesday night through Thursday.   </p>
