<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A major winter storm remains on track to ramp up from W to E on Christmas day as it moves into our region with increasing widespread rain and snow.</p>
<p>Â Light snowfall commences during the morning hours with snow levels around 2500 ft west of the Cascade Crest and 500-1000 ft lower snow levels from the passes eastward with increasing low-level E flow. Expect moderate snow to develop by the end of the day in most areas, but the Olympics ramp up into the moderate to heavy range in the mid-morning hours, followed by Mt Baker by late morning. These areas will also experience moderate to strong ridgeline winds as SSW flow buffets the region.</p>
<p>The most intense precipitation with this seasonally cool atmospheric river arrives Wednesday night with the passage of the initial frontal system. Expect very heavy rain and snow along with a subtle increase in snow levels relative to Wednesday. Moderate to SSW winds continue to ramp up with moderate SE flow at low-levels.</p>
<p>A secondary developing moves into SW British Columbia early Thursday as heavy rain and snow continue across the region. Winds wrapping around this low have a "poisonous tail" meaning you can expect a period of strong to extreme ridgeline winds for areas favored by WSW flow. Once this bout of wind passes, rain and snow becomes showery and snow levels should linger around 3500 ft. This switch from E to W flow during the late morning hours should result in a jump in snow levels for the E slopes of the Cascades. Uncertainty remains, but Snoqualmie Pass proper likely changes to rain from early Sunday onwards.</p>
