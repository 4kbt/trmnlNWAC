<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Our week of beach weather crested on Friday, as mountain travelers were greeted with sunny skies and temperatures soaring into the 50's at 5000ft. A weak front approaches this evening, as clouds thicken and lower. Temperatures and snow levels fall into the 4000-6000ft range with the frontal passage on Saturday morning, but weak is the important descriptor for this system. Precipitation totals are paltry, totaling less than a tenth of an inch across the board Friday night and Saturday during the day, bringing not much more than a dusting of snow at best. Aside from scattered lingering showers on the west slopes on Saturday, many locations, especially south and east, will see sunshine in the afternoon. Temperatures will remain cool with moderate to occasionally strong westerly winds targeting the East Central and East South zones Friday through much of the weekend.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Saturday night into Sunday, a trough drops down from the north, bringing with it an uptick in precipitation throughout the forecast area. With below-normal temperatures, snow levels will continue to lower into the 3000-4000ft range. Storm totals aren’t much, but whatever does fall this weekend will be at its heaviest Sunday mid-morning through the overnight hours into Monday, as precipitation favors the west slopes and passes from I-90 North. </p>
