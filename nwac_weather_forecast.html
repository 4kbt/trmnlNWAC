<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The weekend brings a welcome drying trend, although temperatures remain unseasonably mild. Very light rain and drizzle linger along the west slopes of the Cascades through Friday evening as the warm front shifts into Canada. The high pressure displacing the precipitation will bring clearing skies and warmer, sinking air, along with decreasing light-to-moderate westerly winds.<br type="_moz"/>
Freezing levels peak Friday evening in southern portions of the forecast region, pushing 10,000–13,000 ft. Only the deepest valleys and the highest volcanic summits might cling to temperatures below freezing. Further warming is expected across northern Washington State on Saturday as low clouds banked against the west slopes of the North Cascades early give way to nearly full sunshine. Despite the warmth, increasing afternoon southwest winds will make it feel cooler. Light rain arrives late Saturday night, with snow above 6,000–8,000 ft. Precipitation peaks Sunday morning, then tapers in the afternoon as the front fizzles. Mount Baker may receive over 0.75 inches of water equivalent, while most other areas see less than 0.25 inches by the end of the day on Sunday.</p>
