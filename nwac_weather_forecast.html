<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The high pressure ridge responsible for this extended streak of dry weather will bend but not break today as a short-wave disturbance approaches from the north. Most locations should start the morning with mostly sunny skies. Eventually, high clouds move into the region and should thicken and lower in the afternoon. Temperature inversions are well established in many of the mountain valleys, passes, and cold air sinks. As W-NW winds increase today ahead of the "storm", this should help mix out temperatures at lower elevations and usher in warmer air. </p>
<p>While areas close to Mt Baker could see a few flurries just before sunset, most precipitation holds off until the evening. Unfortunately, there's not much left of this weak system by the time it arrives. Most sites won't see more than a healthy dusting of snow. What it lacks in moisture, the system makes up for in cold air. Look for temperatures to quickly fall this evening, rapidly bringing snow levels to below most trailheads. This should keep what little precipitation that falls as all snow except at the lowest elevations. </p>
<p>By sunrise, the storm is finished and the high-pressure ridge rapidly rebounds. Initially, the Pacific Northwest will sit under the far eastern extent of the ridge. Cold, dry, northerly flow aloft draws chilly air in from Canada. Mostly sunny skies and decreasing winds will allow for a bit of daytime warming as we return to a prolonged dry weather pattern. </p>
