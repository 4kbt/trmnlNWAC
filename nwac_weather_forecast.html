<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Snow is falling across most of the mountains and along the valleys on the east side of the Cascades as a frontal system slams into the Pacific Northwest this afternoon. We're just getting started as warm frontal moisture rides along in westerly flow and precipitation rates peak later this afternoon and evening, with the heaviest precipitation/snowfall totals expected for the south and central WA Cascades before precipitation begins to taper off late tonight. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we'll see a slow warming trend as the jet stream lifts north with this system, so we can expect some lower and even mid-elevation trailheads near and south of I-90 to experience a change to rain later tonight, with even higher snow levels for Mt Hood. During this warm-up tonight, we may see a few hours of light freezing rain, especially near the Snoqualmie Pass corridor, although this is unlikely to be a significant icing event. </p>
<p>We'll see a bit of a break in the action on Wednesday, as another frontal system gears up offshore. Snow levels will be on the mild side and there should be plenty of cloud cover in advance of the next system.  Warm frontal precipitation may glance the Mt Hood area and the southern Olympics Wed afternoon. </p>
<p>The warm front will lift north Wednesday night towards the Canadian border as the trailing cold front slowly approaches. Periods of light rain and snow, with a chance of freezing rain for the Passes Wednesday night will give way to steadier precipitation on Thanksgiving.  Snow levels will be middling with this storm, with snow levels generally in the 4000-5000' range for the Cascades. </p>
