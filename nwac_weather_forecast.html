<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>For the next 48 hrs or so, the PNW will be stuck between two major weather features: a strong jet stream aimed at British Columbia and a cut-off Low pressure wobbling around California. This will create a stark difference from north to south across the region. Expect generally cloudier conditions and a better chance of precipitation from Highway 2 (Stevens Pass) to the Canadian border. </p>
<p>For nearly the entire forecast area, things should be dry Thursday night. Clouds in the Olympics and in the north Cascades will keep conditions mild. Meanwhile, clearer skies and generally light winds in the southern zones should allow for temperature inversions to form in some of the mountain valleys and passes. This could result in patchy fog, particularly near lakes and creeks. </p>
<p>A short-wave system passing well to our north will drag high clouds across nearly the entire area on Friday, with only the southernmost locations remaining sunny. A few showers could begin to impact the Olympic Mountains in the morning, but precipitation won't trickle into the Mt Baker region around lunchtime. Mild conditions should result in rain at most trailhead elevations with a few inches of snow in the higher terrain. </p>
<p>Conditions don't change much from Friday night into Saturday. Mild temperatures, cloudy skies, and occasional light showers prevail from the Mountain Loop Highway northward. Further south, you'll likely find warm weather, periods of sunshine, and passing high clouds. As a more substantial weather system approaches the area late Saturday afternoon, look for clouds to increase, thicken, and lower. This heralds a bigger change to come overnight. </p>
