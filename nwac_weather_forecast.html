<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The flood gates will begin to open later tonight as a series of weather impulses ride up and over a strong ridge parked offshore through the weekend and well into next week.  Warm frontal moisture will arrive late tonight and into Thursday with additional impulses Thursday night and Friday.  The west slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood, particularly the central Cascades, should see 1-2 inches of water through Friday afternoon. Snow levels will rise a bit on Thursday and even more on Friday, with lower and even eventually mid-elevation trailheads transitioning to rain.  On the cooler side of the pattern, the Mt Baker and Stevens Pass base areas will see mostly snow through late Thursday night/Friday morning with a warm-up following during the day on Friday. Mt Hood will be on the opposiste end of the warmth spectrum, with snow levels high in the 6000-8000' range. </p>
<p>Strong W-NW winds will be a constant at Cascade crest level and higher.  This will also cause downsloping, and strong drying along the east slopes of the Cascades during this period.  Expect much drier conditoins the further east you travel from the Cascade crest. </p>
