<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High pressure will keep the Pacific Northwest warm and dry through the work week.</p>
<p>The ridge flattens Monday night, enabling some increase in upper-level winds that will start to show up as W ridgeline winds gradually increase overnight into Tuesday. By the afternoon, these winds could be moderate at times for areas near and east of the Cascade Crest. Expect a few scattered low clouds in the afternoon alongside some filtered sunshine at times on Tuesday. Ridgeline winds shift NW and increase slightly more as a trough digs down the spine of the Rockies before easing on Wednesday. A few models maintain a slight chance this system touches off a bit of moisture, but most models keep the moisture to our east. Freezing levels peaked in the 9000-11500 range on Monday and gradually start to descend to 8000-10000 ft by Tuesday afternoon and more significantly to 6000-7500 ft by Wednesday afternoon.</p>
