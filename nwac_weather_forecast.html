<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Temperatures remain unseasonably cold over the Pacific Northwest. A WSW-ENE-oriented elongated trough sits over the region. A weakening surface low just SW of the Olympic Mountains will continue to spin mostly light snow into the west slopes of the Cascades from around I-90 northward, thanks to a diffuse band of convergence snowfall as weakening Fraser outflow interacts with SW winds around the surface feature. This feature should mostly impact the western Highway 2 corridor and gradually taper through the mid-day hours. Expect partly to mostly cloudy skies across northern Washington by the afternoon, with slightly moderating temperatures.</p>
<p>High and mid-level clouds associated with a stronger system moving into California will continue to drift northward across the southern Cascades, providing filtered sunshine that transitions to obscured skies. By the afternoon, expect some very light snow to develop for Mt Hood up to White Pass, along with a shift to generally light SE winds. This pattern continues Thursday night and Friday. Expect far more sunshine in the northern Cascades.</p>
