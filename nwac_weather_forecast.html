<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak occluded front is rotating up from northern Oregon this morning. This weather feature will spread light snow over Mt Hood this morning and eventually up to the southern and central WA Cascades later today, with drier conditions further north. Snowfall amounts will be in the 1-4" range today. Clouds will slowly thicken as the frontal band rotates up today and we expect some filtered sunshine to hang on for areas closer to the Canadian border through this afternoon. </p>
<p>The bigger story will be the wind and the continued cold temperatures. Strong E-SE winds will rake the central and southern WA Cascades and Mt Hood, although all areas will be impacted.  Winds will begin to back off from the peak mid-day.  Single digits and below zero temperatures are widespread once again this morning, with warmer temperatures further west of the Cascade crest and the Olympics. For the Mt Hood area, near the Cascade crest and along the east slopes of the Cascades, expect dangerously low wind chill values today - layer up appropriately. </p>
<p>The low pressure complex will shift inland Thursday night and will bring renewed light snow to the Mt Hood area with lighter snow showers further north. The flow will become westerly on Friday, with light showers mainly along the west slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood. The change in wind direction will also allow a slight moderation in temperatures with snow levels bumping up to 1000-2000' across our area. </p>
