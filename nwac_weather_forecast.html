<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>230pm Update: Added context to convergence zone expected Tuesday night for the central Cascades. </p>
<p>It’s been a nice morning and early afternoon along the Cascades. Precipitation has largely stopped, except for a few lingering showers north of I-90. Skies have cleared near Mount Hood, with broken cloud cover along the crest. Most of the volcanoes are emerging from the low-level clouds. Winds have shifted to westerly, and high-level clouds are beginning to move in from the northwest.</p>
<p>Temperatures will continue to drop overnight as a strong frontal system moves into the region. Snowfall will likely begin early Tuesday morning, with peak intensity through the afternoon for the central and north Cascades, and in the evening for the south WA Cascades and Mt Hood. Cool temperatures will keep snow levels at lower elevations, generally below Snoqualmie Pass. There may be a slight warm-up around midday Tuesday through late afternoon, but it won’t last long before temperatures drop again. Strong westerly winds will accompany this system, presenting some difficult travel in the mountains and whiteout conditions.  </p>
<p>Snowfall will continue Tuesday night into Wednesday, though at a relatively slower pace, before the next system arrives. The caveat for Tuesday night will be a convergence zone that has the potential to nail the Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie corridor (current models favor Stevens for enhanced snowfall) with significant snow spilling over to the east side of the Cascade crest. Snowfall will be measured in feet over the next few days, with more along the west slopes of the Cascades and Mt Hood, and still modest, but lesser amounts along the east slopes of the Cascades. </p>
