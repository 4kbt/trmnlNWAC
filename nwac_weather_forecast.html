<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest will be stuck in mild weather pattern for the remainder of the work week.</p>
<p>Some cooling behind Wednesday morning's frontal passage will be short-lived for areas west of the Cascade Crest as a warm front rounds the top of the broad ridge over our region. Clouds lower and thicken over western Washington overnight, with periods of light rain and higher elevation snow spreading into the Olympics and west slopes of the Cascades during the morning hours. As the front lifts northward, so does the precipitation, bringing partly clearing skies south of I-90 during the afternoon. However, increasing S winds will help squeeze out the moisture in the Mt Baker area during the afternoon and evening hours as the shortwave trough moves over the area. During this time, Mt Baker could get 0.75-1.5" of rain, with snow above 6500 ft.</p>

Precipitation eases as the ridge rebounds Thursday night into Friday. Another weak system riding over the ridge approaches the coast with some light precipitation late Friday.</p>
<p>Continue to expect a chance for a wintry mix any time precipitation spills over into the passes or east of the Cascade Crest. However, temperatures will be marginal for frozen precipitation in these areas.</p>
