<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>I won't sugarcoat it. It's wet out there... REALLY wet, warm, and windy. Many weather stations this afternoon are showing 0.2-0.35 inches of water per hour, temperatures in the 30s-40s, and strong and gusty winds. Yuck! Conditions won't change much as we head into the evening and overnight. A very strong atomspheric river remains zeroed right at the Pacific Northwest. Look for the heaviest precipitation rates from about Hwy 2 south to Mt Hood. These locations could see an additional 2-3 inches of water by Tuesday morning. However, this isn't just a west-side event. Very strong winds continue to carry rain and high elevation snow to locations further east. </p>
<p>The bulk of the precipitation starts to drift south into Oregon after midnight, allowing rain and snow to taper for places like Mt Baker and Washington Pass. By day break, the firehose of moisture is aimed at Mt Saint Helens and Mt Hood, with areas further north experiencing a break in the action. As the precipitation moves south, colder air pushed into the area from Canada, allowing significant cooling. Unfortunately, as the snow levels drop, the moisture tap turns off. It's unlikely we'll see substantial snow accumulations at trailhead elevations. </p>
<p>The break doesn't last long. The next tidal wave of moisture arrives Tuesday night, once again bringing very heavy precipitation, strong and gusty winds, and rising temperatures to the mountains. Areas near and west of the crest could see sustained periods of 1/4 to 1/3 inches of water per hour. Right now, this second system seems focused on the central Cascades from the Mountain Loop Highway to Mt Rainier; however, some models show it shifting further north. We'll have to wait and see. So, while there's some uncertainty about how much precipitation each location receives Tuesday night and Wednesday, rest assured, it's going to be wet and wild!</p>
