<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal system approaches NW Washington Monday night, spreading more clouds and some light snowfall at times into portions of the Olympics and the Mt Baker with a few flurries making it south as far as Snoqualmie Pass. Most other areas will experience some partial clearing with light W winds maintaining more low cloudcover along the west slopes of the Cascades than further east.</p>
<p>The weak front stalls over NW Washington early Tuesday and lifts northward as a warm front associated with an approaching low approaching the PNW nearshore waters. This feature will spread light precipitation throughout the region during the afternoon hours as SSW ridgeline winds gradually increase.</p>
<p>The aforementioned low tracks toward Vancouver Island Tuesday night, increasing light to moderate rain and snow along with moderate to locally strong SSW winds in areas impacted by this flow pattern such as the Mt Baker area and the Olympics.</p>
<p>A deep upper trough in the wake of the low begins to move onshore Wednesday as a band of light to moderate precipitation remains over the Cascades. Winds gradually ease throughout the day.</p>
<p>Temperatures remain near or slightly below seasonal norms throughout the period.</p>
