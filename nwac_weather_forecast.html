<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Friday will be a transition day from a cold, snowy pattern to a progressively milder one. The upper trough axis that moved through Thursday morning continues to slide eastward as a ridge moves from the west. NW winds aloft continue to ease along as moderate ridgeline winds, focusing on several areas near and east of the Cascade Crest, generally shift into the light range during the morning hours. By 7 AM, most of the snow shower activity along the west slopes of the Cascades has transitioned to snow flurries over the Cascades; however, a few snow showers are visible on moving NNE over the western Olympics, guided by an approaching warm front. As the day progresses, expect increasing filtered sunshine with cloud cover lingering much longer into the afternoon for the Mountain Loop and Mt Baker areas.</p>
<p>High clouds continue to move into the area Friday night as temperatures continue to moderate on gradually increasing SW winds.</p>
<p>A warm, wet frontal system gradually moves ESE into the region on Saturday. It will begin impacting the Olympics in the morning, then Mt Baker and perhaps the Mountain Loop in the afternoon. Snow levels will rise to 4000-5000 ft in the Olympics. Although temperatures may rise above freezing Saturday morning in the Mt Baker area, the precipitation should lower snow levels to 4000-4500 ft as it moves into the area in the afternoon. SSW winds are likely to increase into the moderate range for favored areas around Mt Baker, with strong gusts likely.</p>
