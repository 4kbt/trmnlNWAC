<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A strong winter storm continues to bear down on the Pacific Northwest this afternoon. However, given the orientation of the front, some locations could see significant snowfall, while others are left with mainly wind.</p>
<p>The first wave of precipitation is already on our front door. Southerly flow with this round will focus the storm on Mt Baker, Crystal Mt, Mt Rainier, Mt Hood, and Mission Ridge. Other locations along the Cascade Crest and Passes will see much less snowfall. Expect strong and gusty winds to develop in similar locations resulting in a very storm night in the mountains. </p>
<p>Some locations could see a short lull in the storm Saturday morning. However, the trialing cold front should quickly reinvigorate precipitation rates. With this second round of snow, southwesterly winds keep the bulk of the precipitation trained on the west slopes of the Olympics, Cascades, and Passes. In general, snow levels should stay below major winter trailheads. However, Snoqualmie Pass could see a short period of rain as cooling easterly flow turns west in the afternoon and conditions warm slightly. While snow totals don't look overly impressive on Saturday, gusty winds will keep most locations feeling downright stormy. </p>
<p>Post-frontal showers continue Saturday night and into Sunday morning. Even still, the general trend will be for drying and even a chance at some sunshine as a transient high-pressure ridge shifts over the area. The best chance for sunshine will be near and east of the Cascade Crest. </p>
