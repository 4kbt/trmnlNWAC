<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The cold, snowy pattern continues through Wednesday, then shifts toward milder, less stormy conditions as we approach the weekend.</p>
<p>The advertised narrow band of precipitation associated with a comma-shaped frontal system is moving through the Cascades early Wednesday afternoon. The brief shift to SSW winds was less favorable for mountain enhancement and reduced snowfall rates in many areas. However, another slew of vigorous showers can be seen on radar and satellite imagery that will move into the Cascades during the late afternoon hours as winds shift more westerly. These winds will be strongest on Wednesday night and peak on Thursday as a trough moves over the region, a ridge builds offshore, and atmospheric pressure gradients tighten. The cooler air aloft, moderate to strong W ridgeline winds, and instability showers will produce low-density snowfall throughout the region. With a lot of low-density snow already on the ground, expect significant snow transport in exposed terrain through Thursday. Temperatures should reach their minimum for the week on Thursday morning, before beginning a gradual moderating trend.</p>
<p>Some convergence off Vancouver Island is also expected to increase snowfall in the southern Mountain Loop and Stevens Pass areas late Wednesday night into Thursday, but it is likely to be a diffuse, weak enhancement.</p>
<p>NW flow aloft continues as the ridge of high pressure progresses toward the Pacific Northwest Thursday night and Friday. Snow showers gradually taper and then end from S to N on Friday. While we expect the end of the snowfall to bring snow levels down to 3000-3500 ft, freezing levels will climb to 5500-6000 ft with increasing sunshine near Mt Hood. In short, by Friday afternoon, the cold, snowy pattern enters the rearview mirror.</p>
