<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Sunny and dry weather will close out the last weekend in January. Dry and increasingly mild weather will extend into the middle of next week before we start to get a hint of a more active weather pattern towards the end of next week.  </p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is between two large scale weather features; the first a strong ridge of high pressure that's centered offshore and directing the storm track well to our north and second, a closed upper low over California. The upper level ridge will start to become the dominant weather feature as it nudges closer to the coast and noses into southern British Columbia over the next 36 hrs. Milder air and high freezing levels will show up along the Olympics and west slopes of the Cascades today with the battleground near the Cascade crest where colder temperatures are entrenched along the east slopes of the Cascades, and especially further south near Mt Hood.  E-NE winds will finally ease today, hanging on the longest near Mt Hood, as the closed upper low pulls further south.  </p>
<p>Expect even milder conditions and generally light winds on Monday. </p>
