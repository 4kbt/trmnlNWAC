<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>NNW flow aloft continues to trap low-level moisture with enough onshore gradient to touch off some very light snow showers or flurries through Saturday night and possibly into Sunday morning. Given the direction of flow, the stabilizing atmosphere, and ridgeline winds decreasing into the light to moderate range, most of these snow showers or flurries won't even make it to the Cascade Crest, so look for them on the western foothills. Convergence will focus some of the snow shower activity in the central Cascades south of the mountain loop. The west slopes of Mt Hood could also see up to 1" of new snow. A disturbance moving southward Sunday night seems unlikely to tap into enough moisture to bring a real uptick in snowfall.</p>
<p>Winds on the volcanoes will continue to be the most impactful weather Saturday night into Sunday morning. The south side of Mt Hood should see decreasing strong winds Saturday night, transitioning into the moderate range at some point Sunday morning as the stronger northerly winds aloft shift offshore.</p>
<p>The offshore ridge of high pressure expands into the region Sunday night and Monday. Freezing levels will remain low through Sunday evening but expect inversions to develop along with multiple freezing levels Sunday night into Monday as subsidence increases over the region.</p>
