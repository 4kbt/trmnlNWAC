<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Isolated light showers across the west slopes of the Cascades, Mt Hood and the Olympics will taper off this evening along with light to moderate NW ridgeline winds as a weak upper level ridge traverses over the Pacific Northwest.  An unimpressive low pressure currently offshore will track northwards late tonight through Tuesday towards Vancouver Island.  An occluded front will sweep from SW to NE during the day on Tuesday, spreading precipitation over the Olymipcs and Mt Hood area before mid-day and areas further north in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Most areas will see a short-lived burst of heavier precipitation as the front sweeps northward on Tuesday. Snow levels will quickly lower to 3500-4000' with the onset of precipitation. S-SE winds will increase out ahead of the front for the Olymipcs, Mt Baker and Crystal Mt areas and behind the front, all areas will see W-SW winds increase Tuesday afternoon. Significant post-frontal showers will continue for the northwest Cascades including the Mt Baker area Tuesday night. Showers will be more scattered and lighter elsewhere as snow levels fall to 2000-2500' Tuesday night. Moderate to strong post-frontal westerly winds will continue overnight with the highest winds along the east slopes of the Cascades. </p>
<p>A broad upper level trough offshore will turn the winds S-SE over the area on Wednesday. This should allow a fair amount of cloud cover to drift up over the area along with a chance of showers and may cause moderate SE ridgeline winds. Freezing levels will hang out near 4500-5500' on Wednesday. </p>
