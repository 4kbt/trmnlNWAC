<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak cold front sweeps down from the northwest on Thursday bringing impactful winds, strongly cooling temperatures, and some very light snowfall. Temperatures are dropping quickly in advance of the late morning frontal passage with high clouds lowering early this morning. A weak convergence band formed early this morning in the Mt Baker area and should gradually shift southward as the day progresses, reaching central Cascade passes in the afternoon. Ridgeline W winds focus on areas near and east of the Cascade Crest, ramping up into the moderate to strong range from mid-morning through the afternoon. In the Mt Hood area, these winds peak in the afternoon through early evening hours and could be sustained in the strong range.</p>
<p>A few very light showers may linger between Snoqualmie and Crystal in the early evening hours before upper-level flow shifts more NNWerly and moisture cuts off. Once it does, expect clearing skies, but a cold day on Friday with freezing levels topping out around 3000 ft.</p>
