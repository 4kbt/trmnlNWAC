<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest will transition into a warmer drier pattern heading toward the weekend.</p>
<p>However, the broad trough over the western United States will continue to generate enough instability to keep shower activity going for the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics on Wednesday evening. These showers will move in from the NW and models project the potential for very weak convergence to focus around 0.1" of water equivalent in the Crystal Mountain area. Low-level east flow maintained stronger winds at Snoqualmie Pass level than the top of Alpental on Wednesday. The strength of the low-level W winds should gradually ease overnight cross-Cascade pressure gradients back off a touch. Winds should be generally light across the region by Thursday.</p>
<p>Expect a cool start to the day with low clouds banked against the west slopes of the Cascades and some clouds spilling over into the immediate lee of the Cascade Crest early in the day. Expect decreasing clouds and warming as the day progresses. In the afternoon, popcorn cumulus clouds could be widespread. A few models have isolated rain/snow showers moving in on N flow, but they will be few and far between. Freezing levels should rise to around 5500-6000 ft across the region.</p>
<p>An offshore ridge expands into the region Thursday night through Friday bringing sunny skies. There will be pockets of below-freezing temperatures in colder valleys, but freezing levels will rise to 6500-7000 ft by Friday afternoon. Winds will be light and variable.</p>
