<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The deep upper low off the Pacific Northwest coastline wabbles back towards the coastline. Following a primarily dry Tuesday evening will enable instability and showers wrapping around the low to move back into the region during the overnight hours. Light to occasionally moderate snow showers will focus initially on Mt Hood and the southern Cascade Volcanoes, then spread into the Mt Rainier area. The upper low spawns a surface feature off the mouth of the Columbia River early Wednesday, focusing a more organized band of light to moderate snowfall (or snow showers) out ahead of it. This precipitation will be accompanied by a shift to increasing light to moderate winds focusing on the same general areas. Low-level ENE winds also create upslope flow and light snowfall for the easternmost part of the Cascades (Mission Ridge). Snow showers and snowfall expand and intensify as the surface low lifts northward Wednesday afternoon, but the heaviest snowfall remains around Mt St. Helens, which could pick up 1 ft of snow by the end of the day. Paradise, Mt Adams, and Mt Hood can expect 2-5" of snowfall while other areas generally can expect up to 3". Expect another helping of similar amounts over the same general areas Wednesday night as the precipitation expands northward.</p>
<p>The upper low morphs into an elongated trough by Thursday, keeping a few weak instability snow showers over the area, but winds should be light, temperatures continue cold, and snowfall amounts quite limited.</p>
