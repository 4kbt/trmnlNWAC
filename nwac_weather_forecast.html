<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A few showers associated with an upper level weather disturbance passed from north to south today with lingering showers this afternoon over the south WA Cascades and near the Mt Hood area. We'll see E-NE ridgeline winds become NW-erly as the upper level features drops further south tonight towards California and upper level ridging begins to nose over the PNW. Scattered showers will quickly peter out later this afternoon and outside of some low clouds banked up along the west slopes of the Cascades, we'll see a clearing trend take hold overnight. </p>
<p>The storm track will oscillate around north/central B.C., allowing us to stay dry over the next few days.  We'll see a slow warming trend Monday and Tuesday but mid and upper mountain temperatures won't stray too far from the freezing mark. Along the east slopes of the Cascades, especially near and north of Hwy 2, expect stronger inversions and cooler temperatures below 5000'.  Freezing levels will also be slightly lower in the north Cascades than areas further south. Look for brisk N-NW ridgeline and especially alpine winds over the next few days. While Monday will be mostly sunny, expect a bit more high cloud on Tuesday as the ridge flattens a bit. </p>
