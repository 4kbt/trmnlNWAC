<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, disorganized bands of rain and snow continue to bring periods of rain and snow to the area, moving in on a SSW flow. This relative break comes to an end as a frontal wave currently just off the California/Oregon coast rides NNE into our area Wednesday evening and overnight, bringing a widespread swath of moderate precipitation. The subtle low pressure center is forecast to track just east of the Cascades, helping focus the heaviest precipitation initially on areas on the eastern edge of the Cascades thanks to SE ridgeline winds. In its wake, moderate to strong W winds will be impactful near and east of the Cascade Crest. These winds will peak Thursday morning in most areas. The winds will focus shower activity on the west slopes of the Cascades in the early morning hours through Thursday as snow levels plummet from around 4000 ft in the evening to 2000 ft throughout Wednesday night.</p>
<p>On Thursday, light to moderate and increasingly convective shower activity continues with snow levels remaining around 2000 ft. Thunderstorms remain possible in the afternoon, particularly in southern portions of the forecast region. Locally heavy precipitation is likely in convergence bands focusing on the Mountain Loop or Mt Baker areas during the afternoon.</p>
<p>WSW winds gradually ease along with snow shower and convergence activity focused along the west slopes of the Cascades Thursday night. Friday morning brings a relative break in the action as another system approaches. Light snow spreads into the southern half of the forecast region during the afternoon.</p>
