<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An offshore low lifts a warm front north over the region Friday morning. The band of moderate precipitation extends from Salem, Oregon north to around Stevens Pass. Precipitation should reach the Canadian border by 11 AM. Moderate low-level E flow, combined with SE circulation with the front will create conditions for upslope snowfall on the east slopes of the Cascades and moderate ESE ridgeline winds through the mountain gaps. Behind the front, lighter snow showers continue. Winds should gradually ease as the front lifts through in the mid-morning to early afternoon hours. But don't expect a wind shift at low elevations where gradients remain weakly easterly, maintaining the precipitation type as snow at Snoqualmie Pass. Snow levels start elevated at Mt Hood, but should lower as the day progresses toward ski area bases.</p>
<p>Snow shower activity becomes very light as the offshore upper low and associated trough arrive. Temperatures gradually cool west of the Cascade Crest, with snow levels dropping to 2500-3000 ft for Washington State and 4000 ft for Mt Hood.</p>
<p>W winds increase on Saturday ahead of the next system. Light rain and snow increase in the afternoon along with ridgeline WSW winds. Once again, light E low-level winds likely maintain snow through the mountain gaps, but a mix is possible in the afternoon at Snoqualmie Pass as slightly warmer air tries to over-run it.</p>
