<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're entering a brief interlude between slow moving troughs. Expect shower activity to end early across the west slopes of the Cascades as winds become light and then shift ESE overnight. Freezing levels levels drop to around 3500-4000 ft overnight under clearing skies. The impact of a low well offshore will begin to be felt on Sunday. ESE winds will increase into the moderate range in favored areas near the Cascade CrestÂ  from the Canadian border to Mt Hood. Low clouds will begin to form along the east slopes of the Cascades in response to this upslope flow. At the same time mid-level clouds will gradually thicken, obscuring skies by the afternoon. Light rain and will at Mt Hood during the late afternoon hours as an initial band of moisture lifts northward. This band spreads northward during the evening hours. The E flow will enable steadier and heavier precipitation for the E slopes of the Cascades. Scattered rain and snow showers continue behind the initial wave as snow levels drop below 4000 ft.</p>
<p>Monday may bring a relative break during the morning hours with convective showers in the afternoon. Some areas could pick up 1-4" of snow with snow levels around 3000-3500 ft.</p>
