<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We have some filtered sunshine along with a broad range of mountain temperatures this afternoon. Cool easterly flow and cold temperatures along the east slopes of the Cascades has been battling with milder air to the west.  The mild above-freezing temperatures have made inroads for the Mt Hood area higher elevation sites, West South zone including higher elevation sites like Crystal and Snoqualmie while low-level flow has kept Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, the lower slopes of Mt Hood, and the east slopes of the Cascades in general far chillier. </p>
<p>We'll mix it all up, the lower atmosphere that is, as a weak and dry upper level weather disturbance slides over the area tonight.  This system will bring a high overcast this evening that will quickly clear out before sunrise on Tuesday. This system will also crank up the W-NW winds and bring an end to the easterly flow and widespread temperature inversions.  Tuesday will be a windy, partly to mostly sunny day freezing levels with in the 2000-3500' range, except slightly warmer down near Mt Hood.  If you're planning to climb on the higher peaks or volcanoes above 7000', be prepared for strong NW winds.  </p>
<p>The jet stream will reset into norther British Columbia Tuesday night and upper level ridging will once again build over the area.  We'll see a warming trend on Wednesday. That said we're likely to see more high clouds near the Canadian border along with slightly cooler temperatures and freezing levels. </p>
