<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal system moving into our nearshore waters on Sunday keeps intense instability showers focused on the Olympics and Mt Baker areas on Sunday morning. Expect moderate to locally heavy snow to increase in these areas as the day progresses. Other areas will remain mostly cloudy with more isolated shower activity through the morning. As this feature moves towards the coast, shower activity moves back into the rest of the Cascades at some point during the afternoon hours. Moderate snow showers peak for these areas with the frontal passage Sunday evening, while elevated chances for convergence maintain heavy snowfall in parts of the West North Cascades. Snow shower activity tapers overnight as winds shift from SSW to WSW, and low-level winds through the Cascade Passes shift W.</p>
<p>Monday should be nearly a carbon copy of Sunday with another system approaching the coastline. Heavier precipitation once again targets the Olympics and Mt Baker areas on SSW flow, with E flow returning through the mountain gaps.</p>
