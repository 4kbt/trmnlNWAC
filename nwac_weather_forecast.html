<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A few lingering snow and rain showers come to a close in the mountains and foothills this morning as a short-lived ridge pushes across the forecast area. Expect a nice day with some partial clearing, occasional sun breaks, mild temperatures, and generally light winds. This bit of respite will be quick as the next system pushes into the zone late Tuesday evening. Precipitation begins around 10 pm and builds in intensity overnight. Both sides of the Cascades see the action on Wednesday with widespread moderate to occasionally heavy precipitation throughout the day. Snow levels on the west side hover between 3000 and 4000ft while the passes and the east side are closer to 2500-3000ft. Snoqualmie Pass looks to be right on the edge of the rain/snow line and with cold air at the surface, the Pass itself could see some freezing rain anytime between Tuesday night and early Thursday AM.   </p>
