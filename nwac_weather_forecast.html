<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is sandwiched between two large scale weather features; a strong ridge of high pressure offshore and an closed upper low over California. This blocking pattern will keep the storm track well away from our neck of the woods with dry conditions extending into at least the middle of next week. </p>
<p>We'll see a slow warming trend start tonight and continue over the next few days as the upper ridge of high pressure noses its way closer to the coast and into British Columbia. This will cause some unusual freezing level forecasts for Sunday with milder air first showing over the Olympics and north Cascades and cooler freezing levels further south. The Passes and terrain near the Cascade crest will be a battleground, with above freezing temperatures trying to poke in at upper elevations. Persistent E-NE winds (strongest near Mt Hood) will continue Saturday night through Sunday morning before finally starting to taper down Sunday afternoon. No matter where you are, you'll enjoy full sun to close out the weekend.</p>
<p>By Sunday night and Monday, we'll see freezing levels "pop" to 10,000-11,000' across the region as high pressure becomes the dominant weather feature. Temperatures inversions will abound with cooler temperatures down low and milder temperatures found at upper elevations. </p>
