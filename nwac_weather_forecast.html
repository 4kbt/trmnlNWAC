<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Southerly flow aloft is generally not a high-confidence forecast scenario, and that pattern is playing out now and over the next 24-36 hours. Upper level shortwaves ejecting from an upper low offshore will pass from south to north over the area today, tonight and on Sunday, bringing a round of light to moderate precipitation each time along with bursts of S-SE winds.  </p>
<p>Snow levels along the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics will generally be in the 5000-5500' this morning. Cold air along the east slopes of the Cascades has moderated, but it's still just cold enough for snow levels of 2000-3000' near and north of I-90, and milder further south.  However, there are pockets of freezing rain along the eastern slopes and valleys. That freezing rain potential extends to Cascade passes, especially Snoqualmie and White, and to a lesser extent Stevens this morning.  The Stampede Pass weather station has been reporting freezing rain for several hours. </p>
<p>The precipitation will pass north today, continuing the longest and heaviest for the Mt Baker area.  We'll see sunbreaks and freezing levels pop a bit in the afternoon for most other areas.  </p>
<p>We'll do it again tonight and Sunday with additional shortwaves rotating north and the same forecast uncertainties play out. Precipitation looks a bit heavier for the south WA Cascade and Mt Hood Saturday night.  </p>
