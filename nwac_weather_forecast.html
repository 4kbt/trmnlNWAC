<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today was the crescendo of our recent dry weather with lighter winds, widespread sunshine (outside of low stratus along the east slopes and Snoqualmie Pass) and mild temperatures. Balmy mountain temperatures are topping out this afternoon in the 40s and low 50s. </p>
<p>Things are about to change as a fast moving cold front descends from British Columbia tonight and flattens the upper level ridge of high pressure that's currently over the western US. Unfortunately this front is moisture-starved and will not bring much new snow to our mountains. We can expect to see 1-2" of snow for west slopes of the Cascades near and north of I-90 and a trace to nada for areas further east and south. There's a chance for some freezing drizzle along the west slopes of the Cascades from about I-90 southward Thursday afternoon and evening. There will be a sharp cooling trend during the day that continues Thursday night. </p>
<p>The westerly winds will be the biggest story with this weather system. Many areas will see strong westerly ridgeline winds develop on Thursday with extreme winds possible along the eastern slopes of the Cascades. Strong ridgeline winds will decrease from north to south Thursday night into Friday morning. </p>
<p>We'll see a few linger showers Thursday evening with low-level clouds sticking around the west slopes of the Cascades through Friday morning.  Snow levels will have plummeted to near sea level by this time. Post-frontal showers will short-lived as drier northerly flow aloft clears us out, leaving us with a cold dry end of the work week. </p>
