<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A cold, dry, and relatively static pattern continues for the Pacific Northwest, but there are subtle changes from day to day.</p>
<p>Temperatures rebounded Saturday afternoon, particularly for areas near and west of the Cascade Crest as sunny skies dominate. NNW flow will bring a disturbance over the top of the offshore ridge and down the spine of the Canadian Rockies tonight. This will bring a band of low and mid-level clouds over our region along with some directionality to the previously light and variable winds. These winds will mostly impact higher elevations on the volcanoes but do expect ridgeline winds of 10-20 mph out of the WNW for Mt Hood. On Sunday, winds gradually ease and shift from NW to NE. Thanks to these winds, Sunday morning's low temperatures will be cold, but might not be quite as cold as on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Sunday night and Monday, the flattening offshore ridge moves over our region, creating a highly stable atmosphere with inversion conditions likely. Low-level winds increase late Sunday, overnight, and into Monday focusing the coldest air on the east slopes and moderate E flow through the mountain gaps. Meanwhile, expect another round of light to moderate NE Fraser outflow winds heading into western Watcom County. These combine to bring the coldest air of this modified arctic outbreak to our mountains and some serious wind chill to areas impacted by these gap winds. E winds should gradually ease during the day on Monday as sunny skies help temperatures moderate.</p>
