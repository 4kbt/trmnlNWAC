<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>9:50 AM fixed an error in the Hurricane Ridge precipitation forecast for Wednesday.</p>
<p>A cool trough transitions to a weak ridge on Tuesday. Temperatures dropped into the 10s and low 20s in many areas early Tuesday morning and should remain below seasonal norms throughout the forecast period but will gradually increase. Generally light snow showers activity is becoming increasingly isolated as it continues to decrease Tuesday morning, along with a weakening convergence around Stevens Pass. Despite increased atmospheric stability, expect some weak instability snow showers driven by daytime heating in the afternoon. Snow levels should rise from around 500-1000 ft in the morning to 2000-2500 ft in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A few snow showers could continue from Snoqualmie Pass to Mt Hood Tuesday evening, but expect precipitation to cut off overnight.</p>
<p>A warm front lifts northward ahead of the next system Wednesday morning with low-level E flow increasing throughout the day. Light snow initially develops along the E slopes of the Cascades, with light snow spreading to most areas later in the day. This system could bring impactful E winds to the passes and S winds to the Mt Baker area in the afternoon.</p>
