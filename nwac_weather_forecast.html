<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">A strong jetstream targeting the Pacific Northwest will continue the onslaught of winter storms through the weekend. On the heels of Friday morning’s system, a sprawling and well-developed storm has started spreading rain and snow into southwest Washington and Mt Hood as of early Friday afternoon. Friday night into Saturday, rain and snow will combine with moderate ridgeline winds to maintain stormy conditions. E flow will help keep the passes cooler through early Saturday. However, around the time of the frontal passage sometime in the 7 to 10 AM timeframe, expect a shift to W winds, allowing low-elevation temperatures to rise and transition the passes and east slopes of the Cascades to rain below 3500-4000 ft. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Saturday night will be let up in the action for most of Washington with light post-frontal showers continuing. However, a warm front spreads moderate to heavy rain and snow into the southern Cascade Volcanoes overnight into Sunday morning. We’re not sure how far north it gets before a cool trough brings a more unstable air mass into the region. Look for moderate snow showers to develop throughout the area in the afternoon. With cooler temperatures and generally lighter winds, snowfall will become gradually lower density as it stacks up.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent; color:#000000">Snow totals vary widely across the region. By the end of the weekend, many locations near and west of the Cascade Crest can expect 1-2.5 ft above 3500 ft while sites further east could see up to 1.5 ft. </span></p>
