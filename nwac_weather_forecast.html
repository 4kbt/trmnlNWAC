<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Our little disturbance from last night is quickly exiting the region this morning. It left several locations with a small dusting of snow. While most areas will begin the day with clouds and gusty winds, the overall trend will be for drying and clearing. Today's mostly sunny weather will be a bit different from the other days this week. Onshore westerly flow will prevent the inversions that have kept the passes and eastern zones cold and cloudy. Instead, lower elevations on both sides of the range should warm, even if freezing levels appear a bit lower. While we expect plenty of sunshine across the mountains, pesky low clouds could linger particularly along the west slopes and near Snoqualmie Pass. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge rebounds just offshore this evening bringing additional dry and stable air. This will allow for the return of easterly flow, temperature inversions, and low clouds/fog. As cold air once again settles into the Columbia River Basin, the freezing level forecasts get much more complicated. Expect strong inversions in the deep mountain valleys, passes, and along the east side of the range. Multiple freezing levels could form near Mt Hood and the other southern volcanoes.</p>
<p>Depending on your trailhead, it could be cold and socked in to start on Thursday. However, warmer sunnier weather exists above. Low clouds and valley fog may burn off along the west slopes of the Cascades, but expect it to stay entrenched in the passes and east of the crest. Even as freezing levels climb, the air mass isn't hot. Look for temperatures to hover in the mid to upper 30's. Enjoy the sunshine while you can. A potent fast moving system arrives Friday for a notable change in the weather. </p>
