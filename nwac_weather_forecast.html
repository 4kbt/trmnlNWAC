<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">The much-needed snow accumulation pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest as a cool upper-level trough combines with moist WSW winds and an unstable atmosphere. As that moist, unstable air hits the mountains, it triggers moderate to locally heavy snow showers on the windward slopes, with enough wind to push some moisture over the Cascade Crest. More sustained, intense precipitation is possible at times, especially in convergence zones targeting Mt. Baker, the Mountain Loop, and Stevens Pass. These bands of convergence are more likely associated with more organized "comma clouds." The first is passing late Friday and is likely to trigger an uptick in snow showers Friday evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">As the weekend progresses, a trough amplifies offshore, and winds turn more southwesterly. This nudges the precipitation focus slightly northward. As a result, snowfall decreases on Mt. Hood but increases in the Olympics and at Mt. Baker. A more organized system approaching late Sunday should bring some more sustained snowfall to the region during the mid-day and afternoon hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:transparent">Through the weekend, expect 1-3 feet of low-density snow in areas near and west of the Cascade Crest, with lighter totals of 4-8 inches at Blewett Pass and Mission Ridge. Snow levels should be in the 1000-2500 ft range through Saturday morning, then rise 500 ft or so from Saturday morning onward in areas west of the Cascade Crest. The east slopes and passes should stay cooler as light E pass-level winds develop Saturday night.</span></p>
