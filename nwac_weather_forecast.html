<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A broad ridge of high pressure continues to dominate our weather on Friday, featuring sunny skies and unseasonably mild temperatures. Modest low-level inversions in some deeper valleys and mountain gaps should un-invert by about 10 AM as full sunshine in most areas helps to mix the atmosphere. Expect light ridgeline winds for the northern half of the Cascades, but light to moderate ridgeline winds in some areas near the Cascade Crest from White Pass south to Mt Hood. Any cloudcover should be relegated to areas adjacent to the Canadian border and a low stratus deck below 500 ft in the Puget Sound Lowlands that mixes out as the day progresses. Expect little in the way of change Friday night as the ridge slides eastward, but low-level E flow increases slightly, strengthening the low-level cold pool somewhat east of the Cascade Crest.</p>
<p>Saturday starts sunny, but high clouds move in from the west during the mid-day hours and start to lower and thicken late in the day as an offshore trough drifts towards our nearshore waters. Ridgeline winds should decrease relative to Friday and the direction shifts from SW to SSW.</p>
<p>Throughout the next 36 hours, freezing levels will range between 7000 and 11000 ft, with the warmest temperatures in the southern Cascades.</p>
