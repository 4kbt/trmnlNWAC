<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Change is afoot in the Pacific Northwest as a flattening ridge allows further cooling and opens the door to active weather. Temperatures cooled off overnight into the 30s for most mountain locations. The cooling trend should offset typical daytime warming, resulting in a more limited temperature range for many areas. The exception will be areas east of the Cascades where a strong, shallow low-level inversion set up overnight. These areas should mix out as moderate SW ridgeline winds generally stir the atmosphere. High clouds will create filtered sunshine in the morning, giving way to obscured skies in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A potent frontal system begins to spread precipitation into the area Thursday evening, first in the Olympics and Mt Baker areas, then spreading throughout the region overnight. By morning, expect widespread moderate to locally heavy rain and snow. Snow levels should be in the 2000-3500 ft range for the mountains of Washington, but as a warm front moves over the area Friday morning, precipitation rates become heavy. Snow levels rise by around 500-1000 ft, but E flow will likely insolate Snoqualmie Pass from the warming through at least the morning hours. The afternoon is more uncertain. The cold frontal passage should hold off until Friday evening.</p>
<p>Snowfall amounts should be in the 6-18" range for the Cascades through Friday above 3000 ft.</p>
