<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The next frontal system is making its way into Western Washington this morning. Precipitation is becoming widespread along the coast and the Olympics and is beginning to push into the west slopes of the Cascades, with snow levels around 4000ft. The cold front will pass through this afternoon, bringing heavier precipitation and strong SW winds. Snow levels will bump up just a bit over the course of the day. Though both sides of the range will see the action, the western slopes and especially the volcanoes are favored to see the largest totals. A convergence zone takes aim at the West North and West Central zones this evening, bringing continued precipitation, while showers and wind speeds begin to taper elsewhere as an upper-level ridge starts to build overnight into Wednesday. </p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">As the ridge takes form, any remaining showery activity should come to a halt on Wednesday morning, perhaps with the exception of a stray drop or two near the Canadian border. It’s a relatively weak ridge, so we won’t likely go full bluebird. Expect a mix of sun and clouds with increasing temperatures. Calm weather lasts through the day and into Thursday in advance of the next system.</p>
