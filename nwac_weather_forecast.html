<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High pressure will expand into our region, bringing plenty of sunshine, light winds, and warm temperatures over the next 36 hours. However, most locations can expect a chilly start to the day on Sunday. The coldest temperatures can be found in higher-elevation valley locations where the light winds and clear skies have allowed cold air to pool. Expect temperatures to rebound rapidly during the daytime hours as freezing levels rise to 5500-6500 ft in the afternoon and possibly higher by the end of the day.</p>
<p>This warming trend continues Sunday night at middle elevations, but lower elevations below 5000 ft should expect some cooling. Monday should be the warmest day of the week, with freezing levels rising to 9500 ft in the north and 11500 ft in the south. Some areas in the southern Cascades could experience some light to moderate SE winds Monday morning as the ridge shifts inland.</p>
