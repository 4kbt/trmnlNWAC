<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The offshore ridge continues to bring clear/sunny skies and light winds to most mountain locations as it moves toward the coast Tuesday night and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Broad-scale subsidence keeps us in a highly stratified atmosphere with an inversion in place. This gives us primary freezing levels in the 8,500-11,000 ft range through Wednesday morning, with secondary freezing levels in the 4000-5000 ft range. If you're below this secondary freezing level, expect frigid temperatures near and east of the Cascade Crest. Low-level mostly light E flow gradually decreases through early Wednesday.</p>
<p>The flattening of the offshore ridge beginning on Wednesday opens the door to increasing WNW winds and cooling from N to S. This cooling should occur at most middle and upper elevation locations, but expect some areas to warm at low levels as the atmosphere begins to mix. These light to moderate winds focus on the mountain gaps and E slopes of the Cascades Wednesday afternoon and continue through Thursday as winds shift SW in advance of the next system. High clouds also arrive late Wednesday night and gradually lower and thicken on Thursday. Some very light precipitation may reach the Olympics and Mt Baker areas late in the day.</p>
