<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in a very active pattern with frontal passages every 12-18 hours. The frontal system currently impacting our region is associated with an offshore low. The front arcs across the northern Olympics and into the southern Cascades to start the work week and brings moderate rain and snow to much of the region. Snow levels range from 2000-3000 ft with E flow lowering snow levels slightly through the mountain gaps and east of the Cascade Crest. This also allows the precipitation to spill over onto the east slopes of the Cascades. The steadier precipitation ends from SW to NE as the front lifts away from the area, replaced with some light rain and snow showers for the afternoon.</p>
<p>The forecast becomes more uncertain heading into Monday night and Tuesday. A weak front lifting northeast spreads a band of light to moderate rain and snow to the southern and central Cascades, mainly during the overnight hours. Southerly winds aloft continue with low-level E flow.</p>
<p>A stronger warm front approaches the region during the day on Tuesday with precipitation spreading from SW to NE across the area. Precipitation becomes moderate to heavy by the afternoon for much of the region as snow levels rise to 2500-4000 ft for the central and northern Cascades and 4000-6500 ft for the southern Cascades and Olympics. SW ridgeline winds will also become moderate to strong late in the day.</p>
