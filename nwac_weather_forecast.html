<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A slow-moving offshore upper-level trough brings southerly flow aloft along with a chance of mainly rain showers through Monday. Much of the energy associated with the trough shunts southward toward California, directing any more significant precipitation south of our region.</p>
<p>Freezing levels peaked on Saturday and Saturday night, but the gradual cooling as the trough moves toward the coast will impact NWAC forecast elevations more slowly. The bulk of the cooling is expected to occur on Monday morning for the Olympics and later on Monday afternoon through Monday evening as the trough moves onshore. However, models predict this cooling at different rates, so the timing remains uncertain. Shower activity peaks Sunday night, but will be light. Cooler air moving in aloft may allow for an uptick in shower or light rain/snow activity late Monday through Tuesday in the northern half of the Cascades. Snow levels are expected to lower to around 3,500 ft by Tuesday.</p>
