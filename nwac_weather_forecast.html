<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>For most locations, it's a chilly and gusty morning in the mountains. While a high pressure ridge keeps us dry, a short-wave disturbance passing to our north will bring a few nuances to what has been a very repetitive forecast. </p>
<p>The weak short-wave system will flatten the ridge today leading to two more notable changes. First, expect gusty W-NW ridgeline winds. These will be strongest in the eastern forecast zones and on Mt Hood. If you're heading higher on the volcanoes or other notable peaks, very strong alpine winds could make travel extremely difficult. Secondly, high clouds should increase especially in the afternoon. This could bring more filtered sunshine or even overcast conditions. Combine the increased clouds and winds and you get a day that should at least feel much chillier. </p>
<p>The high pressure ridge quickly rebounds overnight causing winds to sharply decrease and skies to clear. Patchy fog could develop in some deeper mountain valleys and passes, particularly near creeks and ponds. After a chilly start Wednesday morning, temperatures rise as the ridge drifts closer to the coast. Warming will be most pronounced in the Olympics, Hood, and West South zones. The question becomes, can developing easterly flow bring entrenched cold air from Central Washington into the eastern portions of the Cascades and Passes. </p>
