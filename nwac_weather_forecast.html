<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After a rather quiet day, things are starting to change. The first hints of our next storm are already becoming apparent across the mountains. High clouds have begun to push in from the SE and ridgeline winds switched to the S-SE. Even the first bands of precipitation are showing off the coast on radar.</p>
<p>This storm will move inland overnight and looks eerily similar to our storm from Sunday night/Monday morning. Precipitation moves from SSW to NNE across the area. It should reach locations near and south of I-90 in the mid to late evening (6-10 pm) before spreading northward around midnight. Weather models look juicier this afternoon than this morning. Favored locations like Mt Baker, Mt Saint Helens, Mt Hood, Crystal, and Mt Rainier could see near or above an inch of water. With southeasterly winds, upslope precipitation along the eastern forecast zones favors areas like the Wenatchee Mountains. </p>
<p>While the precipitation is impressive, the gusty winds will make this event feel particularly stormy. Winds increase significantly in the evening and remain strong until they finally shift more westerly sometime tomorrow morning. East flow in the passes should keep Stevens and White Pass as snow, and maybe a rain-snow mix at Snoqualmie. As winds turn W, expect a slight bump in temperatures that could bring a brief period of rain or mixed precipitation to all the passes. </p>
<p>Showers linger through the morning hours focussed mainly on the west slopes of the Cascades and Passes. As we move into the afternoon, showers wane and you could even see sun breaks, particularly in the southern and eastern areas. This sets us up for a quiet Christmas Eve for Santa to visit good little girls and boys.  </p>
<p>Christmas morning looks cloudy, cool, and calm. This won't last long, a parade of strong storms is set to impact the region starting late in the day. It's hard to say when the first wave of precipitation will arrive. It could be before sunset or it might hold off until the evening. Either way, get out and enjoy the new toys early before the weather turns. </p>
