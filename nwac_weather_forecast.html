<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas to everyone this morning. While it might not be the White Christmas many of us ask Santa for, there will be a few showers in the mountains today. A weak band of precipitation is lifting northward this morning, spreading precipitation along both sides of the Cascades. East to Southeast winds should help develop slightly heavier upslope showers in the eastern forecast zones. The downside to this weak disturbance is that it also brings slightly warmer air. Snowlevels will creep up this afternoon and evening. The feature stalls near the Canadian border late in the day, focusing more precipitation on the North Cascades. </p>
<p>Winds shift to the SW in the evening, and become stronger and gustier. This should draw up-slope snow showers east of the crest to a close. While a few showers may bring a bit of precipitation overnight, the bulk of the moisture should stay focused on the Mt Baker area. </p>
<p>On Friday, a short-wave system arrives in the Pacific Northwest. This time, more westerly flow aloft will help this storm be a notch colder. A few showers in the morning give way to steadier, light to moderate snow in the afternoon. While not a huge snow producer, many areas near and west of the Crest could recieved 4-8 inches by the evening, with about half that expected east of the divide. </p>
