<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An elongated trough sits off the PNW coastline. It features a N-S band of clouds just moving onshore Saturday afternoon, and a band of light precipitation just offshore. This initial band will pivot onshore as a perturbation within the broader trough moves towards the mouth of the Columbia River Saturday night and ejects southward off the Oregon Coast as a closed low on Sunday. Light rain and snow will reach the Olympics and west slopes of the Cascades from around Snoqualmie Pass southward in the 3-7 AM time frame. WNW flow develops in the wake of the trough with just enough instability to trigger some instability across most of the west slopes of the Cascades. Still, it continues to focus on the southern Cascade Volcanoes. Expect snow levels in the 4000-4500 ft range with elevated freezing levels in drier areas of the northern and eastern Cascades.</p>
<p>NW flow aloft Sunday night and Monday brings the potential for some enhanced windspeeds on the southern sides of the volcanoes, peaking early Monday. Meanwhile, expect convergence to focus locally enhanced, but generally light rain and snow on the central Cascades. Snow levels should drop to around 3500 ft.</p>
