<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A closed offshore low rotates a frontal boundary northward into Oregon on Sunday. High clouds and ESE winds are already increasing ahead of the system early Sunday. The day will start with filtered sunshine in many areas but expect obscured skies by the afternoon. Moderate ESE winds continue to increase throughout the day in favored areas, particularly near and just west of the Cascade Crest. Light rain and snow start in the Mt Hood area around mid-afternoon, then spread onto the east slopes of the Cascades south of I-90. The initial band of moisture focuses on the southern Washington Cascades during the evening hours and the northern Cascades overnight and slightly favors the east slopes of the Cascades. Winds shift SW in the wake of this initial moisture band as snow levels drop from 4000-4500 down to 3000-3500 ft on Monday. Showers may slowly fill in behind this initial wave of moisture, Sunday night into Monday morning. However, they should increase with more widespread convective showers returning as the low approaches the Oregon Coast during the late morning through afternoon hours.</p>
