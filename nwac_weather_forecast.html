<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Buckle up! We're in for a very wild and extremely wet few days! A pair of atmospheric rivers will take aim at the Pacific Northwest, bringing eye-popping amounts of precipitation, generally warm temperatures, and very strong and gusty winds. We'll be measuring the water in multiple inches range. Yikes!</p>
<p>The first tidal wave of moisture is arriving as I type (6am). Look for very heavy rain and high elevation snow to develop in the mountains by mid-morning. Once it starts, it won't let up for about 18 hours. Areas near and west of the Cascade Crest could see numerous hours of 1/4 to 1/3 inch of water per hour. Warm air will cause snow levels to climb during the day, peaking in the late afternoon/evening around 6500-7500 feet. Very strong winds should help precipitation pour across the crest throughout much of the storm. So, while east-side zones won't see quite as much rain and snow as their western neighbors, this will still be a major event. </p>
<p>The atmospheric river shifts south into Oregon in the wee hours of Tuesday morning. This keeps the firehose going for Mt Saint Helens, Mt Adams, and Mt Hood. Right now, it's hard to say if places like Mt Rainier, Crystal, and White Pass stay in the bullseye or see a break from the storm. Further north, a cold front will drift down from Canada, helping temperatures to cool. Sadly, as snow levels drop, the moisture tap turns off. As a result, places near I-90 and north should see a break in the storm on Tuesday with just a few light showers and maybe even a few moments of sunshine. </p>
<p>The rollercoaster ride isn't over, though. The second onslaught of precipitation arrives Tuesday evening, bringing another round of very heavy rain/snow, rising snow levels, and very strong and gusty winds. </p>
