<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The mid-January dry spell continues as an unusually strong high-pressure system remains centered just offshore. The light N winds aloft, rounding the high pressure, will have little impact on surface conditions. The bigger impact remains the subsidence and warming associated with the high. Overnight lows at most NWAC stations remained in the 40s. Inversion conditions exist throughout the region, with temperatures increasing with height up to around 6000 ft. East of the Cascade Crest and through the mountain gaps, a secondary freezing level exists at lower elevations (perhaps rising into middle elevations where the cold pool is deeper in the Methow Valley). This cold-air pool has become shallower but colder over time. Morning temperatures will be in the 20s at many trailhead locations, but expect to climb quickly into spring-like temperatures as you rise into middle elevations. Widespread stratus persists across the Columbia Basin with fingers spreading into deeper valleys throughout the east slopes of the Cascades, reaching as far west as Snoqualmie Pass. Given how cold this air is, it is unlikely to retreat east from the Pass much before noon.</p>
<p>The colder air at low levels continues to drive a moderate pressure gradient and low-level E flow through the mountain gaps. Expect moderate ridgeline winds in localized areas near the Cascade Crest from around Snoqualmie Pass southward. Higher ridgeline areas such as Crystal Mountain aren't receiving these winds, but E winds are cranking through slightly lower elevation areas such as Chinook and White passes early Sunday.</p>
<p>We're not expecting much change in the pattern through Monday morning, other than a very subtle lowering for freezing levels from 10,500-12,000 ft on Sunday to 9,000-11,000 ft on Monday. </p>
