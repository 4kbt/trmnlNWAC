<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Wow, that was a wild, wet night across the mountains! Most weather stations recorded 1-3 inches of water overnight!!! Temperatures continue to cool this morning with a few inches of snow accumulating at some trailheads. Washington Pass managed to stave off the warm weather and stack up 8 inches since yesterday evening. <br/>
Most locations will see a break in the action today as the thrust of the precipitation shifts south into Oregon. This morning, low clouds and a few showers could give way to moments of blue sky, particularly in the northern and eastern zones. Gusty wind along the east side of the range should also decrease. Clouds will start to thicken and lower this afternoon ahead of our next tidal wave of precipitation. The exception to today's 'break' will be Mt Hood and Mt Saint Helens. Down south, heavy rain, very gusty winds, and warm temperatures will maintain stormy conditions. Several hours of 1/4 to 1/3 inch of water per hour are likely. </p>
<p>This evening, another atmospheric river slams into the region. This one is just as wet as Monday's storm; the big difference is that it looks much longer and a notch warmer. Expect sustained very heavy precipitation rates (1/4"-1/3' per hour) near and west of the crest. Strong winds also carry moisture to the eastern zone, providing inches of water for most locations. Snow levels will quickly climb as rain begins to reach 7000-8500 ft overnight. Washington Pass and the East North zone will try to hang on to cold air and maintain snowfall. They probably will through the night, but by Wednesday, the flood of warm air should finally overtake the area and send snow levels climbing above the pass. The storm doesn't let up on Wednesday. Most locations continue to experience heavy rain and high elevation snow. </p>
