<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak shortwave disturbance swings through the region overnight mainly bringing colder air, along with clouds and a period of slightly stronger winds. Temperatures cool quickly this evening. By the time any precipitation arrives, snow levels should be below most trailhead elevations. Unfortunately, the system won't have much moisture left. Areas along the west slopes of the Cascades from about Mt Rainier north could see a healthy dusting of snow. High-end "storm" totals of an inch or two are possible for the Mt Baker and Mt Loop Highway areas. Even if your locale isn't expecting measurable precipitation, don't be surprised by a few flurries. </p>
<p>The whole event should be over by Friday morning. As the high pressure ridge quickly rebounds, cold and dry northerly flow aloft sets up over the region. This should help any lingering clouds or flurries quickly clear out of the area. With much colder air in place, we'll see weak daytime warming, as temperatures stay on the chillier side despite the sun. </p>
<p>A cold clear night on Friday will allow weak temperature inversions to form in the mountain valleys, passes, and other low-lying areas. With plenty of sunshine, temperatures warm slightly again on Saturday. However, NE winds bring a steady stream of cold air into the mountains from Canada. With the high pressure ridge back in place, this marks the start of yet another prolonged dry period. </p>
