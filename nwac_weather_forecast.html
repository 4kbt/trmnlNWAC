<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A weak frontal boundary stalled along the Columbia River gorge will become reinvigorated as an upper-level trough pushes the frontal boundary inland overnight. Precipitation will spread northward overnight along both sides of the Cascade crest, with the heaviest precipitation along the south Washington Cascades and Mt. Hood. More significant precipitation will finally reach the northern Cascades around sunrise as the frontal boundary pushes east of the Cascades mid-morning. The frontal passage will usher in a period of post-frontal showers and strong W-SW winds across the area for the rest of the day.  Afternoon showers will be heaviest from roughly the Mt. Loop Highway and north. Snow levels will generally range from 2000-3500'. </p>
<p>The fun won't stop in this pattern as a new developing frontal wave slams into the south Washington Cascades and the Mt Hood area Saturday night while lighter showers continue for areas further north overnight. There's increased confidence that the Mt Hood area will see a warming trend Saturday night (snow levels may push near or above 5000') along with extreme SW winds and heavy precipitation. It's unclear how far north the axis of heavy precipitation and extreme winds extend into the south/central WA Cascades. The Mt Hood area and possibly the southern WA Cascades will likely see a few feet of snow at mid and upper elevations by the end of the weekend.  </p>
<p>The forecast evolution uncertainty continues into Sunday. The Olympics and WA Cascades will likely be in a cool showery pattern common for spring-time. The Mt Hood area looks to be on the northern fringe of continued heavier precipitation and strong to extreme winds.  </p>
