<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A persistent high pressure parked offshore continues to dominate the weather in our region. A closed low parked over southern California completes the blocking pattern that will fend off storm track through the first half of the work week.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest can expect light northerly winds aloft, sunny/clear skies, and 10500-11000 ft freezing levels. With the high pressure providing subsidence and minimal wind to mix the atmosphere, continue to expect a stratified atmosphere with cold air pooling below 5000 ft east of the Cascade Crest and light to moderate E winds ushering that cold air through the mountain gaps. Cold air pools will be more limited to valley locations east of the Cascade Crest. Expect these inversions to mix out by late morning in most areas, but Washington Pass and areas well east of the Cascade Crest may not warm up.</p>
<p>Further west, cold air pooling will be more limited to valley areas. Places like Mt Baker, Paradise, and Hurricane Ridge stayed above freezing Sunday night and won't look back over the next few days. This stands in stark contrast to Mazama where the temperature is 0F at 6AM this morning. However, Washington Pass base is 20F and Washington Pass Upper is 36F; so if you want to thaw out, you'll just need to ascend out of the cold pool!</p>
