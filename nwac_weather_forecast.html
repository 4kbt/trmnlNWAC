<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Whatever weather you like, you can probably find it in the mountains today. Snow, sun, wind, calm, clouds, rain, warm, chilly.... You get the idea. It's a real mixed bag out there. Showers continue to linger this morning along the west slopes of the Cascades, primarily from I-90 northward. While these are generally light, they may be locally heavy, especially under a Puget Sound Convergence Zone. Showers should quickly wane through the morning, hanging on the longest near the Canadian border. Elsewhere, skies are already starting to break. Even if it's a bit cloudy to start the day, expect plenty of sunshine near Mt Hood, east of the Cascade Crest, and in the West South zone. </p>
<p>An open trough moves inland overnight, bringing with it clouds, a bit of precipitation, and continued cooling temperatures. Look for clouds to thicken and lower during the evening. The timing of the increasing clouds will have a big impact on overnight low temperatures. If the clouds delay, temperatures should dip significantly. Showers spread from N to S after midnight and linger into the morning. Without ample moisture and poor dynamics, most of the snow fizzles near and west of the Crest and only a few flurries make it much further east. Even though temperatures are cold, the snow totals from this "storm" aren't impressive. Favored areas could see a whopping 2-4 inches.</p>
<p>As the trough pushes overhead Saturday morning, moderate NW winds peak and quickly start to decline. A building high pressure ridge helps draw snow showers to a close and causes skies to start clearing. Most areas should see some sunshine by late Saturday afternoon. </p>
