<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A complex winter storm system is tracking toward southern Vancouver Island on Thursday. A band of moderate snow lifts NE across the region Thursday morning, ahead of an occluded front. The heavier precipitation targets the central and southern Cascades during the late morning through evening hours as the system's warm sector passes through. This will create some complex weather for the passes as low-level E flow intensifies, keeping the pass levels cold, while warmer air moves in above 4500 ft. This makes the risk for freezing rain during peak precipitation from around 3 PM to 7 PM before the front pushes through and the flow switches westerly. This westerly flow brings decreasing light to moderate rain and snow, transitioning to all snow as snow levels drop to and then remain around 1500 ft by Friday morning. With an upper trough offshore and sustained light to moderate WSW flow, expect snow showers to bring substantial accumulations to the W slopes of the Cascades Thursday night and Friday.</p>
<p>We're expecting 6-10" snow totals for areas above the rain/snow line on Friday, but rain or freezing rain will eat into snow totals below 4500-6500 ft for the central and southern Cascades. The southern Cascades should pick up the most snowfall Thursday night, with up to 5-15" of snow, and 3-8 further north. Friday will bring another 4-10" of snow for many locations across the Cascades.</p>
