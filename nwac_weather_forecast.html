<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a very cold morning across the region with most mountain weather stations reporting temperatures in the single digits to low teens. Brrrrr! Bundle up! Low clouds and fog continue to linger from about Hwy 2 south to Mt Hood. While it's not "snowing," the frigid temperatures are ringing every little bit of moisture out of the sky in the form of snow flurries. </p>
<p>The Cascades sit right on the boundary between a broad open trough to our east and a strong high pressure ridge to our west. A weak dry short-wave disturbance will slide south into Washington from British Columbia today. This will usher in much drier air and help areas in the north and central Cascades to become mostly sunny. In the south Cascades and near Mt Hood, this same feature should increase low and mid-level clouds and might even result in a few very light snow showers. There's pretty low confidence in any measurable precipitation but places like Mt Rainier, Mt Adams, and Ahutanum Meadows have the best shot at a dusting of snow. Areas near Snoqualmie Pass and Crystal Mt sit right in the middle and could go either way. The biggest impact for most locations will be an increase in easterly winds. This will be most notable in the Passes and right along the Cascade crest. Winds peak in the early evening as the dry front passes over the area. </p>
<p>As the short-wave system exits, northerly flow aloft will bring dry arctic air from northern Alaska into the PNW. Any lingering clouds should quickly dissipate overnight, resulting in clear skies that allow temperatures to plummet. Expect 5000ft temperatures to plunge into the single digits with wind chill values well below 0F. After a frigid start to the day, sunny skies will help temperatures warm slightly. Make sure to bring the big puffy and very warm gloves!</p>
