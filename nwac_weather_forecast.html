<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Several waves of moisture will rotate into the region Sunday night and Monday as an offshore low heads toward the Oregon Coast. The first wave of moisture lifting north is bringing some light rain and snow to the Mt Hood areas Sunday afternoon. This band will target the southern Washington Cascades in the evening and the northern Cascades overnight. Moderate to locally strong ESE winds ahead of this wave will ease in its wake as wind switch SSW. Shower activity may be slow to fill back in behind this wave, but some light shower activity should continue Sunday night and Monday morning as snow levels lower from 4500 ft Sunday evening to 3000-3500 ft on Monday. Shower activity may become more vigorous, widespread, and convective with some embedded graupel on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The upper low moves onshore Monday night, but the general impact for our region will be broad troughing and generally light winds. This creates the conditions for decreasing scattered to isolated rain and snow showers through Tuesday. Expect snow levels to drop to 2500 ft (below seasonal norms).</p>
