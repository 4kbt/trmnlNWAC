<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The interminable ridge parked just off our coast will finally begin to lose its complete grip on our region, but it won't fade easily. Warm middle and upper elevations, strong temperature inversions, and low-level easterly gap winds remain in the forecast. However, a weak disturbance sliding down the east slopes of the Rockies Monday night will bring subtle changes.</p>
<p>Freezing levels start around 11,000-12,000 ft Monday night as the dry front moves into the region from the north, but lower somewhat on Tuesday in its wake. WNW ridgeline winds increase into the 5-15 mph range overnight, but run into the wall of low-level cold air east of the Cascades and likely ride over the top. This is likely to set up a complex interplay of W winds along higher ridgelines and E winds for ridgelines near the major mountain gaps. The WNW winds push south on Tuesday morning.  Ridgeline winds above the cold pool shift back E temporarily by Tuesday afternoon. Light to moderate pass-level winds should increase with upper-level support. Thin high clouds should filter the sunshine on Tuesday</p>
<p>Tuesday night through Wednesday, expect clear skies and a gradual decrease in freezing levels to around 8,000-10,000 ft. Winds aloft will be light out of the NW, and gap winds will be light to moderate from the east.</p>
