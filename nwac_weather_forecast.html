<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest remains in a cold, unstable pattern. Shower activity extends from a trough digging southward offshore into the Pacific Northwest. These cells arrive at the coast on SW winds and bring relatively continuous precipitation to areas near and west of the Cascade Crest, but with significant variations in intensity. Precipitation should continue to decrease for Mt Hood and the southern Cascades Saturday night as an increasingly southerly wind component steers the moisture further north. The shower activity decreases into the light to occasionally moderate range for the I-90 corridor southward overnight into Sunday morning. Expect shower activity to fill back in across the region Sunday afternoon and evening with a disturbance moving through the region and another round of moderate-to-heavy snow showers. Sunday night into Monday morning brings another relative letup in shower activity before a more organized frontal system brings a round of heavier snowfall starting late Monday.</p>
<p>Temperatures continue to rise a few more degrees in areas west of the Cascade Crest through Sunday afternoon, then drop Sunday night and rise again on Monday. Near and east of the Cascade Crest, easterly flow should keep the passes cool.</p>
