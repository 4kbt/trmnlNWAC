<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A vigorous front passed through the Cacasdes early this morning, bringing with it heavy precipitation, rapidly falling snow levels, and extreme winds.  Snow levels have settled in around 2500' before sunrise and will stay around this mark through Thursday morning.  Snow showers will pepper the mountains today in westerly flow.  Periods of convergence will enhance snowfall near Stevens Pass to the Whatcom/Skagit border along the west slopes of the Cascades.  E-W Convergence bands will occasionally carry heavier showers well over the crest and along the east slopes of the Cascades.  We're still looking at storm totals of about 6-18", with the high snow mark of +2' deep in the Cascades north of Stevens and south of Washington Pass.  </p>
<p>Extreme west winds (sustained 30-60 mph) across the mountains will cause low visibility and persist through midday, then slowly ease.  Strong downsloping winds along the east slopes of the Cascades will mix to lower elevations/valleys.  Showers will taper slowly this afternoon and overnight, although moderate snow showers may continue in the Mt Baker area overnight. </p>
<p>The wild weather ride continues as a low-pressure system will spread warm frontal precipitation into Oregon and the Mt Hood area during the morning, pushing heavier precipitation into the south/central WA Cascades in the afternoon, with lighter precipitation farther north. Along the warm front boundary, we can expect rising snow levels and another round of extreme winds toward the latter half of the day.  The West South and Mt Hood zones should bear the brunt of the warmer air, and Snoqualmie Pass may see a period of freezing rain Thursday afternoon before switching to rain in the early evening.  Mt Hood and potentially Mt St Helens will see very heavy precipitation during the day. </p>
