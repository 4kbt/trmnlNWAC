<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We'll see varying amounts of high clouds slip under a strong upper level ridge today with a back and forth between partly to mostly sunny skies, and periods of high overcast and filtered sunshine. Most mid-mountain and upper mountain temperatures are above freezing this morning, with a slow warming trend that will continue from today through Wednesday with high pressure in control. It will be chillier at the trailhead with temperature inversions in place. Deeper inversions reaching up to 5000' with colder temperatures can be found along the east slopes of the Cascades, most pronounced over the overnights and mornings. </p>
<p>Moderate NW ridgeline winds will continue today for most areas and slowly start to back off tonight and become lighter yet on Wednesday.  If you are pushing into the alpine on higher peaks today, expect those winds to become strong at times out of the NW. </p>
<p>A fast moving front will approach the area on Thursday. This windy system will bring just a little snow for the northern and central Cascades with less for areas further east and south.  </p>
