<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's a messy 2nd day of 2026 with mild southerly flow aloft and cool easterly flow through the Passes spitting out freezing rain around the major Passes and in areas along the eastern slope of the Cascasdes, especially south of Hwy2.  Temperatures are generally warmer further west of the Cascade crest resulting in a higher snow-line.  Showers are generally heaviest from Hwy 2 and south to Mt Hood this morning. </p>
<p>The good news is that precipitation will become lighter this afternoon as a system pulls away.  The bad news is that we will see another system in southerly flow lift a weak warm front northward tonight. Snow levels will likely come down for the East Central and East North zones while staying mild elsewhere.  Continued cool low-level easterly flow will maintain a chance of freezing rain in the Passes, although Stevens should switch back to light snow Friday night.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, we'll have another messy system on tap with more moderate precipitation west of the crest and lighter precipitation in the Passes.  Although precipitation will be light, spotty freezing rain is still possible in the Passes, and later in the day along the east slopes of the Cascades generally near and south of I-90 later as the winds flip from S-SE to SW along ridgelines.  </p>
