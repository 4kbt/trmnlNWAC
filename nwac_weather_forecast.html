<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An occluded front will spread light precipitation from south to north today with a short-lived burst of precipitation as it passes through. Areas south of I-90 will transition to broken clouds and scattered showers in the afternoon while the front slides towards the Canadian border in the afternoon. Southerly winds will increase this morning and become moderate to strong SW then W later this afternoon and evening. Freezing levels will peak around 4500' today and then fall to 3500-4000' with the onset of precipitation. </p>
<p>Post-frontal showers will mainly focus on the northwest Cascades/Mt Baker area through midnight as snow levels fall to 2000-2500' Tuesday night. Scattered light showers will peter out for other areas more quickly tonight. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, a broad upper level trough of low pressure will be positioned offshore. This large scale weather feature should spill a fair amount of mid-level clouds (scattered to broken skies) northwards during the day, along with a chance of showers, especially in the afternoon. Snow levels will peak between 4000-5000' on Wednesday. </p>
