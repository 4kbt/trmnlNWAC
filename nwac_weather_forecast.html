<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>It's warm out there - mountain temperatures this morning are in the 30s, 40s, and even approaching 50(!) this morning. We'll see the warmth reflected in mid-mountain high temperatures in the 50s to perhaps a few low 60s with freezing levels soaring to 10-11,000' today.  The Atmospheric River that dumped copious amounts of water over our region has finally lifted north but there are a few dregs of light rain near the Canadian border this morning. As this boundary fizzles and lifts further north, we'll see mostly sunny skies today for all areas.  </p>
<p>After an unseasonably warm overnight with temperatures above freezing, we'll see another warm day on Wednesday. We'll start the day with mostly sunny skies but scattered showers should start to pop up especially south of I-90 mid-day and early afternoon.  This warm and unstable air mass will open the door to thunderstorms. Right now, the heaviest showers and thunderstorms look likely to hold off until Wednesday evening and night, but be prepared if thunderstorms start up earlier in the afternoon. </p>
