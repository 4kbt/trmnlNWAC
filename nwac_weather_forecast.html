<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A very active weather pattern will allow the snow to accumulate throughout the work week, but it will be accompanied by impactful winds in most areas.<br type="_moz"/>
A well-defined band of precipitation has reached the Washington coastline on Wednesday afternoon, with light rain and snow developing over the northern half of the Cascades. The moderate precipitation band will pass through the region during the evening hours.Â Expect widespread moderate ridgeline winds, which will be locally strong around Mt Baker and Mt Hood. A secondary low-pressure center crosses the Oregon Cascades and moves into central Washington, increasing the likelihood of steadier accumulating snowfall to the east slopes of the Cascades. Snow levels peak around 3000-4000 ft during the evening hours before dropping to around 2500 ft overnight behind the cold front.</p>
<p>Decreasing light to moderate snow rain and snow showers will focus on areas near and west of the Cascade Crest, with 2000-3000 ft snow levels on Thursday. Moderate ridgeline winds will focus on areas near and east of the Cascade Crest, while winds continue to be strong at times for Mt Hood, particularly in the morning hours.</p>
<p>Without a well-defined break in the action, a more substantial system approaches Thursday evening with widespread moderate to locally heavy rain, snow, and SW winds. The cold front moves through in the early morning hours with a subtle shift to WSW winds, moderate rain/snow showers, and convergence. A well-defined convergence band likely focuses on the Mt Baker area to start the day but shifts southward toward the central Cascades in the afternoon. Snow levels rise to around 3000-4000 ft Thursday night and remain relatively steady on Friday.</p>
