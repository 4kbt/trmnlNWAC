<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Precipitation has become more widespread across the mountains, ramping up in intensity as the afternoon progresses and the cold front passes. A convergence zone will keep the spigot going through the evening hours for areas I-90 north, with its main focus near Mount Baker, Washington Pass, and the Mountain Loop. Outside of the convergence zone, precipitation and winds should peak in the late afternoon before tapering down throughout the evening and overnight, as an upper-level ridge starts to build.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Any remaining showery activity should come to a halt on Wednesday, apart from a stray shower in the north. It’s a relatively weak ridge, so we don’t expect full bluebird, but low clouds should recede in morning hours, allowing for a mix of sun and clouds with mild temperatures and light winds in many mountain locations through the middle of the day. Mid and upper-level clouds build in the afternoon and overnight as the ridge shifts to the east and the mild temperatures continue.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">The next weathermaker hangs offshore Thursday morning as it makes its journey eastward toward the Washington Coast. As of now, it seems that most precipitation should stay out of the mountains, Olympics excepted, until at least the afternoon, but we will have to sort out the exact timing as we get closer. Snow levels begin high but lower sharply with the frontal passage Thursday night into Friday. </p>
