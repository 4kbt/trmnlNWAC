<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Bands of moderate to locally heavy precipitation continue to focus on the Mountain Loop, Snoqualmie Pass, the West South, and Mount Hood, with a rain/snow line somewhere in the neighborhood of 3500-4000ft. Winds are strong down south, but quite light north of I-90. Precipitation diminishes in both distribution and intensity this evening and overnight, while areas north and east see some partial clearing. Any lingering showers should come to a close Tuesday morning as a quick and transient ridge pushes ashore and east flow starts to take root in the afternoon. Many mountain locations may even see some sun breaks with light to moderate winds and mild temperatures. This dry weather will be short-lived as the next system pushes ashore Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Expect another round of widespread precipitation on Wednesday, with snow levels starting around 1500-2000ft and rising to 3000ft by Wednesday night. It’s a quick hitter with the heaviest precipitation beginning to taper Wednesday late in the afternoon/evening.</p>
