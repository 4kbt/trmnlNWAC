<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A splitting system brings some (limited) moisture, plenty of cloudcover, and cooler temperatures back to the region Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>A disorganized band of rain and snow continues to move into the southern Cascades this morning on SSE flow wrapping around an offshore closed low off the Oregon Coast. N flow further north turns NW and increases as the day progresses and weak troughing moves onshore. This shift will bring increasing chances for light rain and snow showers for the west slopes of the Cascades further north as well.</p>
<p>Light to moderate W and NW winds peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will accelerate through mountain gaps, the east slopes of the Cascades, and the SE side of volcanoes. They will also bring chances for light rain and snow showers along the west slopes of the Cascades. If precipitation develops in the central Washington Cascades, it is likely to focus on a weak convergence band.</p>
<p>Snow levels should fluctuate around 5000 ft Friday, 4000-4500 ft Friday night, and 3500-4000 ft further east. Expect somewhat warmer, drier air east of the Cascades throughout the period.</p>
