<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The narrowing and weakening band of moisture associated with the atmospheric river gradually lifts northward as a broad west coast ridge expands northward. Moderate rain (and highest-elevation snow) will linger from the mountain loop to the Canadian Border, with light precipitation gradually ending in the central Cascades. With the faucet aimed further north, Washington Pass is the only area on the east slopes likely to produce substantial precipitation. Snow levels rise to 7000-8000 ft as light to moderate W ridgeline winds gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Tuesday may feel more like summer than the 5th day of Spring. 5000 ft temperates start the day around 40F and rise to 45-55F or more by the afternoon. Some low clouds linger early in the day for Mt Baker and the Mountain Loop, but the sunny start in other areas will take over the entire region as the day progresses. Low-level E flow increases as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Clouds will increase over the Olympics late Tuesday night as the next low approaches.</p>
<p>Wednesday will be an atypical day in the Cascade Cool season. Clouds will increase over mountainous terrain in the morning hours. By mid to late morning, expect showers to develop and drift to the west side of the Cascades on SSE flow. This process will increase with widespread showers and isolated potentially strong thunderstorms developing. This could include small hail or damaging winds. It would be a good idea to stay tuned to the forecast as it evolves before venturing into alpine areas during this weather pattern.</p>
