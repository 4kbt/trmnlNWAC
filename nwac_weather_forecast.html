<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>If you haven't already, settle into our dry, mild and sunny pattern (sunny in the mountains anyway).  A strong ridge of high pressure positioned offshore will keep the storm track well north of our area into the middle of next week.   </p>
<p>Freezing levels will stay in the 11,000 - 13,000' range over this period.  Mid-mountain high temperatures will largely be in the mid to upper 40s near and east of the Cascade crest.  They will be in the 50s for the Olympics, Mt Hood, and for areas west of the Cascade crest Friday and Saturday. The coldest temperatures, near or below freezing overnight in the morning) will be found below persistent temperature inversions at the bottom of valleys and near Passes. Washington Pass will likely be the coldest spot per usual during this stretch.     </p>
<p>Easterly offshore flow will continue to increase tonight and will continue through the weekend. This will create breezy easterly winds through the Passes and at times along ridgelines.  It will also pull very low clouds up to the Cascade Passes. Snoqualmie has the best chance of seeing low clouds/fog squeeze through the Pass proper, while the higher passes are more likely to keep the low clouds at bay to their east.  If you encounter low clouds at trailheads or ski area bases, climb higher to reach much drier, warmer, and sunnier conditions. </p>
