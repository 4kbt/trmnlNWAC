<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Today's snow showers have already started to taper this afternoon, but not before leaving a few inches of fluffy snow along the Cascade crest and near Mt Hood. With lingering low level clouds and very cold temperatures, just about everywhere should see snow flurries this evening and possibly into the morning hours. However, don't expect it to amount to much more than a dusting. The best chance for another inch or two of snow will be in the West South and Mt Hood zones. Just like the snowfall, winds should also die off overnight. Gusty winds will hang on the longest down at Mt Hood, before becoming light by tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Sunday looks like a nice, albeit, chilly day in the mountains. A high pressure ridge building in the Pacific should keep us generally dry. The big question is the clouds. Most locations should start the day pretty socked in. Onshore flow may help the clouds part east of the Cascade crest. With a little more sunshine, temperatures could be slightly warmer than the cloudier western forecast zones. </p>
<p>As the ridge expands to the east, much drier NNW flow sets up over the region. Even though a weak short-wave system appears to slide through the area Monday afternoon, with an overland track, it won't bring any meaningful precipitation. Instead, it will probably only provide slightly windier and cloudier conditions. </p>
