<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Our last storm is finally exiting the region this morning. Showers continue to linger mainly along the west slopes of the Cascades and Olympics. These should draw to a close as a transient high pressure ridge quickly traverses the region. Expect showers to hang on the longest near the Canadian border. </p>
<p>After a rather cloudy start to the day, most location should start to see some sun breaks. Areas east of the crest and further south will have the best chance at significant sunshine. It won't last long though. High clouds should start to push in from the SW this afternoon. It could be a race between clearing low clouds and incoming high clouds for how much sunshine any specific location actually sees. </p>
<p>The next storm starts to arrive overnight with precipitation pushing into the southern Olympics, Mount Saint Helens, and Hood areas in the evening. Snow will spread from S to North mainly impacting locations near and south of I-90. Showers should just start to reach the central and northern Cascades in the very early morning hours. With S-SE flow, this system will bring another shot of snow to the east side forecast zone. Most of the precipitation occurs before lunchtime on Monday, shifting to a more showery pattern in the afternoon. </p>
