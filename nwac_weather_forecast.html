<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High pressure, dry weather, clear skies, and a slow but steady warming trend will define the next few days. Freezing levels will be pegged around 10,000 to 11,000' starting tonight with little change through Tuesday. Ridgeline winds will generally be light, except moderate easterlies for the Mt Hood area tonight through early Monday morning where they are still under the waning influence of a closed upper low for the next 12 hours.  </p>
<p>Besides your sunglasses, you'll still want those extra layers as trailheads will still be chilly to start each day.  Day or night, the warmest temperatures will be found at upper elevations with widespread temperature inversions and cooler temperatures found along lower slopes and valleys. These temperature inversions will be most pronounced along the east slopes of the Cascades, the Cascade Passes and the Mt Hood area.  Temperatures will be slightly warmer on Tuesday with mid-mountain temperatures pushing into the mid-40s.  </p>
