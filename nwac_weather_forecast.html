<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>An upper level trough pushes inland this morning bringing a round of steady snow showers to our region. While everyone should see at least a dusting of snow, most of the precipitation focuses from I-90 south to Mt Hood. This isn't a particularly wet storm, but with such cold temperatures,  mid-elevation sites could see very low-density snow (15:1). Many areas could receive a few inches by the end of the day. Winds with this system aren't overly impressive, but they will target places like Mt Saint Helens, Mt Hood, and Mt Adams. In these spots, you could experience moderate to occasionally strong and gusty winds. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge building offshore will help the region dry out overnight. While the bulk of the precipitation will be over, lingering low level clouds should continue to produce flurries along the Cascade crest. </p>
<p>Dry NW winds aloft should make Sunday a pleasant but chilly day. The question is the low clouds. Most weather models keep the trailheads socked in with clouds and possibly a few very light flurries. Higher up the mountain there should be more sunshine. Generally light to calm winds won't do much to help push out the low clouds, but for the few areas that do break out a bit, it should be a gorgeous winter day. </p>
