<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>A band of precipitation over the southern Washington Cascades fizzles out Sunday evening as the energy from a splitting system drops southward towards California. In it's wake, precipitation will be driven by moderate onshore low-level flow. This will create some light rain and snow showers along with weak convergence for the west slopes of the Cascades and passes with very little spillover to the east slopes. NW flow aloft develops and adds upper-level support to the low-level W-flow, driving a peak in WNW ridgeline winds and shower activity early Monday. Shower activity gradually decreases late Monday as a shortwave ridge axis reaches the coast. Snow levels remain elevated in the 4500-5000 ft Sunday night, dropping to around 4000 ft on Monday.</p>
<p>The final dregs of the onshore flow see weak convergence focusing on the Mountain Loop and North Cascades Monday evening as upper-leve winds shift more southerly ahead of the next system. This system tracks toward Vancouver Island. From mid-morning through the afternoon, expect increasing light rain and snow at 3500 ft snow levels. Mt Baker could experience some strong S winds at times.</p>
