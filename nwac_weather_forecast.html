<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High pressure has once again taken control of our weather, leading to a mostly sunny afternoon and kicking off a warming trend.  Clear skies will continue overnight as the upper level ridge of high pressure centered offshore shifts closer to the PNW.  Freezing levels will jump overnight near and west of the Cascade crest. Below about 4500' (the top of the temperature inversion), expect to find colder temperatures with milder temperatures for upper slopes. The east slopes of the Cascades will warm a little slower where the warmer air will take until Tuesday to push further east. </p>
<p>With clear skies overnight, areas of fog may develop. Light easterly flow may allow for some low clouds near Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, especially along the eastern approaches. Some high and mid level clouds will slip under the ridge on Tuesday, allowing for an increase in cloud cover over the latter half of the day along with some filtered sunshine. Ridgeline winds won't be too strong on Tuesday, but if you're pushing into higher terrain above 7,000, you'll likely to encounter a stiff W-NW wind. </p>
<p>A weakening frontal system will split offshore as it runs into the upper level ridge on Wednesday.  We're unlikely to see precipitation from this weather feature, but plenty of mid and high level clouds should stick around and freezing levels will lower a bit, especially along the east slopes of the Cascades near and north of I-90. </p>
