<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're finally transitioning into an active pattern for the Pacific Northwest, with a significant winter storm on tap for Thursday night into the weekend.</p>
<p>The offshore ridge gradually flattens Wednesday night into Thursday, allowing upper-level temperatures to begin to cool and W winds to increase progressively and focus on the mountain gaps and east slopes of the Cascades. A dry backdoor cold front arrives from the northwest Thursday night through Friday, mixing up the atmosphere and allowing temperatures to drop back into the 30s and upper 20s in most areas (the East South Cascades and Mt Hood will hold onto upper 30s and low 40s into Thursday). The front will bring a 3000-4000 ft layer of marine stratus into the Puget Sound region as mid and upper-level cloud cover increases Thursday night. These high clouds should lower and thicken on Thursday as the main event approaches the coast.</p>
<p>Light rain and snow develop Thursday evening for the Olympics and Mt Baker area, spreading throughout the region overnight and intensifying overnight. E flow also develops through the mountain gaps overnight, lowering snow levels below 3000 ft as snowfall commences. The E flow will make for a tricky forecast as it intensifies while a warm front lifts heavy rain and snow through the region on Friday. Snow levels west of the Cascades rise to 3000-5000 ft by Friday afternoon but stay 1000 ft lower further east.</p>
