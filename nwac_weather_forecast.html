<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>High clouds are advancing over western Washington this afternoon ahead of an incoming albeit weak frontal system.  Most areas are enjoying a fair amount of sunshine, outside of some persistent stratus along the east slopes of the Cascasdes near and north of Hwy2.  Breezy east winds occurring through the major Cascade gaps and along the western slopes of the Cascades will continue this evening but start to taper off as offshore flow falters. The incoming frontal system will spread clouds inland tonight, with some very light precipitation reaching Mt Hood, the Olympics and the southwest WA Cascades.  Snow levels will fall, but we're talking about an inch or perhaps 2 of snow above 4000' for places that do seem precipitation. </p>
<p>The frontal system will split apart over the PNW on Thursday, with a few leftover sprinkles here or there. Cloud cover will be more adundant along the west slopes of the Cascades in the morning, but even here, we should start to see clouds start to break up for the latter half of the day.  Freezing levels will rebound into the 4000-5000' range on Thursday.  Dry conditions and benign weather should continue Thursday night. </p>
<p>On Friday,  the jet stream and storm track will be directed into central British Columbia, and we'll start to see some light warm frontal precipitation move over the North Cascades.  While this is warm frontal precipitation, snow levels should start in the 3500-4000' range in the Mt Baker area in the morning and slowly creep up during the daylight hours. </p>
