<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>The Pacific Northwest remains in the storm track through the weekend. A low is wrapping up off the Washington Coast on Friday afternoon while an associated frontal system brings moderate precipitation to the region. The warm front lifts north of the Canadian border by the evening. Temperatures gradually cool overnight into the 2500-3000 ft range as the trailing trough arrives with light snow showers focused more on the southern Cascades through Saturday morning. Most areas further north will experience sun breaks early Saturday before clouds lower and thicken during the mid-day hours ahead of the next system approaching from the west.</p>
<p>Light to moderate rain and snow focus on the southern volcanoes and the Olympics in the afternoon, but reach the rest of the Washington Cascades by dusk as WSW winds increase. Moderate to locally heavy rain and snow focus on the west slopes of the Cascades Saturday night, with moderate WSW ridgeline winds gradually raising the snow level. The precipitation should stay snow at all the passes overnight but may transition to rain behind the frontal passage early Sunday morning as snow levels rise to around 4000 ft. Light rain and snow showers focus more on the central and northern Cascades on Sunday morning before decreasing in the afternoon. Areas near the Cascade Crest can generally expect 4-10” snow accumulations with this system.</p>
