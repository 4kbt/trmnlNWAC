<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We'll lean into 2025 with an active and complex weather pattern over the next few days.  Waves of warm frontal precipitation will slip under an upper level ridge over the next next 48 hours, targeting the far southern WA Cascades including Mt St Helens and especially the Mt Hood area with several bouts of wintry weather. </p>
<p>The first wave will be weak and arrive this evening, affecting mainly the Mt Hood area and then lifting light precipitation towards I-90 Thursday morning. You'll find drier conditions further north towards the Canadian border. By Thursday afternoon, more significant warm frontal precipitation, mostly snow, will again affect the southern WA Cascades and Mt Hood area with lighter showers further north. </p>
<p>Thursday afternoon will be the wind-up for a low pressure system offshore that lifts moderate precipitation northward and into Washington late Thursday night through Friday.  Cold easterly flow will do a good job at keeping the precipitation type mainly as snow with this system for the WA Cascades. We can also expect moderate to strong S-SE ridgeline winds that begin Thursday night and last through Friday. While there are still forecast details to work out, the Mt Hood area is at risk for a period of freezing rain anytime Thursday night through Friday morning. Snow levels will creep up to 3000-4000' for areas further west of the crest on Friday like Mt St Helens and Mt Baker, and also for the Olympics. </p>
