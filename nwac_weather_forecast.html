<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>After weeks of near constant rain and snow, we're finally about to get a break and see significant sunshine in the mountains. Many places will start the day cloudy. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone is keeping snow falling around Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, but this should quickly draw to a close this morning. Elsewhere, a few showers are adding to the overnight snow totals, particularly at Mt Baker, the Southern Cascades, and Mt Hood. It's also quite windy in many locations near and south of Highway 2. While winds should decrease during the day, expect strong and gusty winds to persist on Mt Hood and Mt Saint Helens. </p>
<p>A high pressure ridge building off the coast will help conditions to dry out and clear up. Sunbreaks should turn to sunshine for many areas, especially in the Olympics, North Cascades, and eastern forecast zones. Mt Hood will likely be the last to cast aside its cloudy coat, and that might not happen until Sunday. </p>
<p>A subtle short-wave disturbance will pass overhead this evening. While some weather models want there to be precipitation with this feature, ensemble guidance just doens't support it. So, expect cloudy skies and maybe a few flurries. If the short-wave exists quickly, clearing skies will allow for low clouds and fog to develop in the mountain valleys and passes. On Sunday, light westerly winds could keep low clouds pushed up against the western side of the Cascades. However, higher in the terrain and east of the crest expect mostly sunny skies and cool temperatures to result in a beautiful winter day. </p>
