<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>Snowfall continues this morning in most areas west of the Cascade crest and north of I-90. A brief convergence zone has set up over Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass, allowing for some locally heavier precipitation.</p>
<p>Today, a drying trend will begin, providing a short break in precipitation. The bulk of the precipitation is expected to taper off by mid-morning, with clouds gradually lightening—especially east of the crest, where it likely will be a sunny day. Low clouds will start to break up along the west slopes, but will linger through Monday. </p>
<p>This break in precipitation will likely last through most of tonight before a new system arrives during the early morning hours on Tuesday. A strong frontal system will push into Western Washington, bringing significant mountain snowfall, with temperatures remaining well below pass level. There is a chance of a brief warm-up Tuesday afternoon, pushing snow levels close to pass level at Snoqualmie, but precipitation is still expected to fall primarily as snow. Besides snowfall, this system will features very strong westerly winds in all areas starting Monday night and really ramping up on Tuesday. Snowfall will continue through Tuesday night into Wednesday. </p>
