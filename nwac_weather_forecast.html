<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in the midst of a very active and impactful week of winter weather in the mountains through the forecast period.</p>
<p>Very light snow shower activity continues Tuesday night as onshore flow arrives over a weak ridge, adding very light amounts of fresh snow above 3000 ft going into Christmas day. Temperatures cool, keeping snow levels below the mountain passes. By the overnight hours, expect rapidly increasing high stratiform clouds to spread across the region, lowering and thickening across the Olympics as a very potent system approaches.</p>
<p>This system will ultimately deliver a long-duration heavy snowfall event. This is due to the arrival of an initial frontal system on Christmas Day, followed by reinforcement from a developing low tracking into southern British Columbia overnight. Moderate to heavy snowfall spreads first into the Olympics between 4 and 7 AM Wednesday, and then throughout the Cascades later in the morning. Precipitation intensifies through the afternoon along with S winds and low-level E flow. Snow levels should be around 2500 ft west of the Cascade Crest and 500-1000 ft lower for the mountain gaps and E slopes of the Cascades.</p>
<p>Snow levels rise overnight and peak early Thursday, with 3500-5000 ft snow levels. We're monitoring a period of very intense W winds associated with winds wrapping around the low-pressure center as it passes. Expect limited cooling behind the frontal passage early Thursday. This front will mark a shift from snow to rain at Snoqualmie Pass up to around 3500 ft. Post-frontal SW flow sustains moderate to heavy snowfall for the west slopes of the Cascades on Thursday with some spillover onto the E slopes.</p>
