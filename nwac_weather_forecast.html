<h4>Weather Synopsis</h4>
<p>We're in for a mostly sunny and mild day as an upper level ridge of high pressure noses into the area. Freezing levels will rise to 7500-8000' across the area and mid-mountain temperatures will climb into the mid to upper 40s. The Cascade Passes, the West South, and Mt Hood will see periods of moderate SE ridgeline winds with weak/moderate offshore flow. </p>
<p>The ridge will shift inland and begin to break down tonight as a weak Pacific frontal system approaches tonight.  We'll have a mild overnight with mid-mountain temperatures above freezing, and some high clouds will begin to move through the region. </p>
<p>We'll see a similar story for Saturday with the mildest freezing levels this week 8000-10,000' but as the frontal system approaches, expect more high and mid-clouds and some filtered sunshine during the day. The front will arrive on Sunday with high snow levels but the this doesn't look like a soaker. </p>
