A frontal system lifting across the region will maintain showers 
across Mount Rainier National Park tonight. Another weather system
will move across the area on Friday, bringing another round of 
showers to the park and strong winds to higher elevations of the 
mountain. Conditions will dry out over the weekend and will 
persist into early next week as a ridge of high pressure builds 
over the Pacific Northwest. Chances of showers return to the park
near midweek.
