<body><b>Mount Rainier Recreational Forecast
<br/>National Weather Service Seattle WA
<br/>329 AM PST Fri Mar 7 2025
<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">Dry conditions are expected across western Washington
through Friday as an upper level ridge moves over the area. The 
ridge will push further inland on Saturday, allowing for a weather
system moving into British Columbia to brush the area over the
weekend, with very strong wind near the summit. Additional 
systems moving into the region next week will bring the potential 
for lowland rain, mountain snow, and gusty winds to western 
Washington.
