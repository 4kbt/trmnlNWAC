A strong cold front will bring heavy mountain snow, and gusty 
winds before additional frontal systems through Thursday bring 
continued heavy mountain snowfall at times. An upper ridge will 
begin to build into the Pacific Northwest Friday, although a 
frontal system over the weekend keeps precipitation potential in 
the forecast.
