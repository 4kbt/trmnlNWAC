<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A frontal system will bring heavy snow across the
mountain Saturday night into Monday, primarily at higher
elevations. A wintry mix is possible around the snow level on
Sunday. Expect the area to remain wet through the week, with
multiple chances of precipitation. Breezy conditions are expected
near the summit. Temperatures will increase slightly towards the 
end of next week.

.IMPACTS...Stormy weather will create difficult backcountry 
skiing and mountaineering conditions across much of the alpine 
terrain of Mt. Rainier, including the Muir snowfield. Blizzard-
like conditions with strong winds and near zero visibility are 
likely. A high level of skill and experience in alpine terrain, 
including use of GPS, is recommended for navigation and camping in
these conditions.
