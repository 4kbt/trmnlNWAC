Generally quiet weather is expected through Wednesday night or
Thursday though strong winds near the summit will create
challenging conditions. The door will open to a series of weather
systems beginning Thursday and continuing into next week. 
Initially the concerns will be gusty winds and high elevation snow then
transition to a river flood threat with strong winds this weekend
into next week. Active weather is likely to continue through at 
least the first half of next week.
