<br/>National Weather Service Seattle WA
<br/>245 PM PST Sat Nov 29 2025
<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">
Cooler and drier weather is in store for the majority of the
week as high pressure settles into the area. Some weak
disturbances may drop into the region on the edge of the ridge
but it won't amount to meaningful precipitation accumulation
except at higher elevations. A stronger system may approach the 
region late next week.
