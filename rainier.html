An active weather pattern will continue across Western Washington
the next few days, but with no significant high impact weather
expected at this time. Increased mid level heights through
Saturday suggest warmer than normal temperatures, but this will
give way to temperatures dropping back to near normal for Sunday-
Tuesday. This will be as a trough brings lower heights to the 
area. However after Tuesday the trend is for increasing heights as
ridging looks to develop over the Western US. This will favor 
warmer than normal temperatures into the start of the New Year.
