<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A series of weak troughs will maintain near-normal
temperatures and bring several chances for light showers across
western Washington through mid-week. The pattern may turn more
active next weekend with potential for an atmospheric river to
bring significant precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, but
considerable uncertainty exists at this time.
