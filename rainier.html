Precipitation will continue to fall over the park with a couple of
frontal systems passing through this evening into the first part
of the weekend. Snow levels will remain high, leaving the best
chance of accumulations at the summit and Camp Muir areas, with
possibilities of a slushy trace at Paradise. Precipitation chances
decrease going into next week, with cooler temperatures.
