for the next few days, allowing for periodic rounds of 
precipitation and cool conditions across Mount Rainier National 
Park. As a disturbance crosses the region into the weekend, expect
steadier precipitation chances and even cooler temperatures, with
snow levels lowering below Paradise late in the weekend through 
early next week. Warmer and drier conditions return under high
pressure later next week.
