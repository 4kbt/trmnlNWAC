<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A pair of weather systems will move through the park
Friday and Saturday. The first one will move through Friday
afternoon. The second one Saturday night. A third system will 
nick the park Sunday night into Monday morning. An upper level 
ridge will build later Monday with the ridge remaining in place 
through the middle of next week. The ridge might not be strong 
enough to prevent weak systems from brushing the park.
