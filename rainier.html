<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">Scattered showers will continue across Mount Rainier
National Park this morning before another system moves into the 
region tonight and brings the next round of lowland rain, heavy 
mountain snow, and strong winds to the area. The pattern looks to 
remain active through the weekend, with the potential for an 
atmospheric river to set up over the region on Sunday, which 
would result in much higher snow levels across the park. High 
pressure building over the region Tuesday will bring drier and 
warmer conditions to the region.
