A series of weather systems will move across western Washington
over the next few days, bringing periods of heavy mountain snow 
to Mount Rainier National Park. Strong winds are also expected at
times through the first part of the week across the higher reaches
of the mountain. A few weaker systems then look to move up into 
the area mid to late week, bringing rain and snow showers to the 
park at times.
