<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">An upper level low will sink southward, wrapping 
moisture into western Washington as it does so and keeping the 
chance for showers over the area. Dry conditions expected to 
emerge by Friday morning. Although generally dry conditions are 
expected for the remainder of the forecast period due to high 
pressure aloft, some weak disturbances may allow for a chance for 
showers this weekend.
