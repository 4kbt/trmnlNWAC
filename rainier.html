Conditions will dry out today under cloudy skies before a strong

gusty winds tonight into Wednesday morning. Another winter system 
will quickly follow, bringing more of the same into Thursday. 
Unsettled conditions will continue into the first half of the 
weekend before a ridge builds over the western US, resulting in a 
drying and warming trend into next week.
