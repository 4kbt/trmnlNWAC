<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A weak ridge of high pressure moving over the region
will bring drier conditions to Mount Rainier National Park 
through today. An atmospheric river will then move into the area 
Friday into Saturday bringing higher snow levels, gusty winds, 
moderate to heavy rain, and high elevation snow. Showers will 
taper on Sunday, however additional systems look to keep 
conditions unsettled across the park through early next week.
