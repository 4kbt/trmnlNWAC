The low pressure system is now along the western coast of
Vancouver Island, and has weakened to a point where it will not
cause headline worthy wind speeds. Pockets of light
precipitation are expected to continue, with light rain again
tomorrow. Temperatures cool off this weekend, with lows in the
low to mid 30s. Upper level ridging is expected late in the
weekend to early next week.
