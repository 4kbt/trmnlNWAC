<body><b>Mount Rainier Recreational Forecast
<br/>National Weather Service Seattle WA
<br/>318 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025
<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A weak disturbance this morning may allow for isolated 
showers, otherwise an upper level ridge will begin to build over 
Western Washington today into Friday bringing a return to drier 
weather. Troughing over the Pacific will shift eastward this 
weekend, introducing a chance for showers. A more organized frontal 
system at the start of next week will be the best chance for
showers in the forecast.
