<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">One more dry and mild day across Mount Rainier
National Park with high pressure in place over the region. Expect
continued smoke from nearby fires to remain today. Stronger
onshore flow will bring cooler conditions, increased clouds, and
stronger winds for the upper elevations of the mountain later this
week. A more significant weather system likely arrives late in 
the weekend with a return of rain and snow to the park.
