lead to diminishing showers across Mount Rainier National Park
tonight. Temporary weak high pressure will provide drier and mild
conditions on Sunday across the park. Another disturbance arrives
early Monday for showers and a return to cooler conditions through
much of the week ahead. Drier and somewhat warmer conditions then
return as high pressure rebuilds late next week.
