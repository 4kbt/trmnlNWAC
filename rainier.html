Mid level trough of low pressure will continue to exit east of the
area tonight. High pressure will nose into the area Wednesday with
a brief warming trend. But by later the week a more zonal type 
flow will be present then trending towards more approaching 
troughing by Friday and Saturday. So warmer than normal 
temperatures mid week will give way to near normal conditions 
through the weekend with rising heights to return early next week
for the next warmup.
