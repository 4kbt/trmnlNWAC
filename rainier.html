<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A series of weak troughs will maintain near-normal
temperatures and bring several chances for light showers across
Mount Rainier National Park through mid-week. The pattern may 
turn more active next weekend with potential for an atmospheric 
river to bring significant precipitation north of the park, but
significant uncertainty remains at this point.
