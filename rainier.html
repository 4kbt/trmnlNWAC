A weak upper ridge will produce dry conditions in the National
Park today. A frontal system will reach the area on Wednesday 
night with light precipitation across the area. A deep upper 
trough over the Gulf of Alaska will bring a stronger frontal 
system into the region at the end of the week with the potential 
for some heavy rainfall and high elevation snow. A trough will 
then settle over the area by the weekend for cooler temperatures 
and the prospect of significant snowfall across the National 
Park.
