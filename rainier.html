<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">Dry and relatively warm weather today. The pattern will 
begin to shift overnight setting the stage for a cooler, showery 
pattern for much of the weekend. A more organized frontal system 
looks to bring more widespread rain later Sunday into Monday
across Mount Rainier National Park. Upper level ridging will 
affect the area by midweek with active weather returning at the 
end of next week.
