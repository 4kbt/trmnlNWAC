<br/>National Weather Service Seattle WA
<br/>258 PM PDT Sat Oct 4 2025
<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">Skies will begin to clear tonight as upper level
ridging begins to build over Mount Rainier National Park behind 
an exiting shortwave trough. This will allow for more clear skies 
as well as warmer temperatures and lower humidity through Tuesday.
Cooler and wetter conditions look to return Wednesday through the
latter half of the week, but details remain uncertain.
