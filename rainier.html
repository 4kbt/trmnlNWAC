A strong and stable ridge will remain in place throughout the
rest of the week and into early next week. Periods of stratus
and patchy fog will occur through then. East to northeast flow
will strengthen into Friday, helping to erode some of the
stratus that has been around for the last several days. Winds will
be at their most breezy in the Cascades and higher elevations.
