<br/></b><p></p><font face="Arial" size="5">A trough of low pressure over the area will weaken 
on Saturday allowing showers to diminish across the region. A 
weak ridge of high pressure will provide drier and mild conditions
on Sunday before another trough arrives early in the coming week 
with additional chances for showers and a return to cooler 
conditions. Drier and somewhat warmer conditions are expected to 
return at the end of next week as high pressure rebuilds into 
Western Washington.
